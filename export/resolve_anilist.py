"""Bind OpenTome's English lines to AniList ids (series.anilist_id).

    python3 export/resolve_anilist.py [build/manga-metadata.sqlite] [--dry-run] [--limit N] [--only NAME] [--covers | --covers-only | --display]

Mangarr resolves a series' poster / description / aliases from AniList by title, and the
2026-09-15 audit (mangarr: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-manga-metadata-audit.md) found
three of its 44 manga entries bound to a one-shot or an anthology that merely carried the
serial's title as a synonym. Mangarr now binds by id and consults the catalogue first, so
this step gives every English line the id up front, with the rules Mangarr's AniListRanker
applies (kept in step on purpose) plus FALLBACK tiers that run only where those rules find
nothing (R4 on; each measured by export/replay_anilist.py to move no existing bind). Mangarr
mirrors R4-R7 since 10.0.0.615 (2026-09-24); there R4/R5 also require the entry name to BE the
hinted catalogue line's own name, never an alias or arc title it was matched by:

  * candidates = AniList `Page(perPage: 10) { media(search:) }`, type MANGA; manga-family
    mediums query `format_not: NOVEL`, novel mediums (light_novel, novel) `format: NOVEL`
  * ONE_SHOT is never bound
  * the volume rule is ONE-SIDED (contract "Volume rule", the same in Mangarr's
    AniListRanker.VolumesAgree): a candidate SMALLER than the line's volume_count by more
    than max(3, 40 % of the line) is dropped (tolerance doubled while the candidate is
    RELEASING), and so is one LARGER than 4x the line; a larger count within 4x is never
    rejected. Junk (one-shots, anthologies) has fewer volumes than the serial; a larger
    AniList count is legitimate -- English 2-in-1 lines (Erased 9 vs 5, Vinland Saga 29 vs
    15) and lines where the catalogue lags an ongoing series. AniList leaves `volumes` null
    on most releasing series, and null is never compared. The 4x ceiling does not apply to
    a line of 1-2 volumes (R2, the 2026-09-15 live run): a one-book release or a run cut
    short binds the full Japanese serial (Pupa: 5 vs 1); the smaller-side rule still applies.
    That exemption is for the line's OWN name (and its de-slugged form) only -- an alias
    retry always keeps the ceiling (R3), or a spin-off's bare franchise alias binds the main
    serial ("Attack on Titan: Harsh Mistress of the City", 2 volumes, to "Attack on Titan",
    34, through "Shingeki no Kyojin")
  * primary-title equality (romaji / english / native) beats synonym equality; ties go to
    `popularity`; equality is Mangarr's TitleMatcher: lower-case letters and digits only,
    after fold() -- which key() and the outbound for_search() term share. fold() strips a
    combining accent ONLY from a Latin-script letter ("Fushigi Yûgi" = "Fushigi Yugi"); kana
    voicing marks, Hangul, CJK and Cyrillic are untouched (2026-09-24: the broad NFKD fold that
    also turned ゲ into ケ was reverted). PARITY: Mangarr's TitleMatcher.Normalize /
    TitleNormalizer.ForSearch do not fold yet -- they mirror fold() in a follow-up task; until
    then the two differ on accented titles only.
    fold() also turns a numeric symbol (No / Nl) into its NFKC form, the fraction slash into "/":
    "Ranma ½" is searched as "Ranma 1/2" (AniList's own romaji) and keys as ranma12; Ⅱ -> II, ² -> 2.
    A synonym-only carrier never wins while ANY candidate on the page has primary-title
    equality, even one the rules rejected (R1, the 2026-09-15 live run): a primary rejected
    on volumes says "this is the work but the count disagrees" (Doll: "DOLL" 1 vol vs 6, and
    the 4-volume "Onegai, Sore wo Yamenaide" carries "Doll" as a synonym), a same-named
    ONE_SHOT is that serial's pilot -- either way the carrier is a chapter title wearing the
    name, and unresolved is recoverable where a wrong bind is not
  * R7 (article, 2026-09-24; Mangarr since 10.0.0.615): below exact equality, the same primary-then-
    synonym equality after dropping one leading "the" / "a" / "an" (a whole word) from both
    sides, R1 included across tiers (never beside an exact primary-title candidate, even a
    rejected one). The catalogue's "Hollow Regalia" is AniList's "The Hollow Regalia"
    (133016) on its own novel page. Measured: that one line, nothing else moved
  * fallback tiers, tried only while the tiers above found nothing on the page (R5 needs no
    equal title on the page -- exact or R7 -- and R4 needs one, so the two never compete):
    - R5 (substring, 2026-09-24): no candidate on the page -- rejected or ONE_SHOT included,
      R1's reading -- key-equals the term, and exactly ONE volume-passing, non-ONE_SHOT
      candidate has a title / synonym key that contains the term's key or sits inside it
      (shorter side >= 4) AND `volumes` equal to the line's volume_count. The exact count is
      what makes it safe: "It's Just Not My Night" (3) is "...: Tale of a Fallen Vampire
      Queen" (3); AniList lists the Bookworm novel per Part, so the catalogue's longer
      "Ascendance of a Bookworm (Part 2: Apprentice Shrine Maiden)" (4) is the SHORTER
      "Ascendance of a Bookworm: Part 2" (4) while Parts 1/3/4/5 (3/5/9/12) share the base
      name. In that candidate-shorter direction the exact count plus uniqueness is the WHOLE
      guard -- any shorter franchise name inside the term qualifies on text alone (Re:Zero
      (A Week at the Mansion) matched 85814 through its synonym "ReZero"). Own-name terms only: allowed on alias terms it bound "Diamond Is Unbreakable"
      to Battle Angel Alita through the alias "Angelo" and moved an existing bind (replay,
      2026-09-24). Measured: 14 new, 1 changed (Der Werwolf: the alias-found 98367, null
      volumes, to 114483 "~Origins~", 11 = the line's 11 and its JP line's 11)
    - R4 (ceiling, 2026-09-24, Weed): an exact primary / synonym match (R1 still applies)
      rejected SOLELY by the 4x ceiling binds -- a short English run of the full Japanese
      serial (Weed: 3 English volumes, 34010 "Ginga Densetsu WEED" 60, synonym "WEED"; the
      old rule fell through to a franchise relative's alias and bound 38901). Own-name terms
      only (R3), and never over an equal-titled candidate that passes the ceiling, even a
      synonym carrier R1 rejected (Worst: 147044, 4 vols,
      stays; the right 31741 is a corrections/anilist.json pin, not a rule). Nor beside an
      article-equal (R7) candidate. Measured on opentome-2026-09-24: Weed plus 10 unbound
      lines, each an exact title; for 9 the AniList volume count equals the line's own origin
      line (Billy Bat 20, City Hunter 35, ...); Aria the Scarlet Ammo is the right work
      (47536, the main Hidan no Aria manga) with 16 vs the origin line's 26
  * no equality on the name -> D3 retry, in Mangarr's order: the de-slugged form of the name
    first (its slug with the dashes back as spaces -- Mangarr's foreign id); then (R6,
    2026-09-24; Mangarr since 10.0.0.615) the name without a trailing parenthetical that is an edition /
    format qualifier -- edition, volume list, release (re-release too), version, tankōbon,
    shinsōban, VizBig, 2-in-1, parution, printing; never one naming a chapter or a nested
    "series (" or a quoted title (`Amazing Agent Luna ("Amazing Agent Jennifer" Volume list)`
    names another work) -- ranked against the name page, else one search. R6+ (round 2,
    2026-09-24) widens the allowlist to Wikipedia's collection / list-article headings -- omnibus,
    perfect collection, publication, list of, manga list, overview, original manga, bunko,
    aizōban, kanzenban, deluxe, "volumes" (never "@comic volumes": My Youth Romantic Comedy's
    "(@comic volumes)" line is the @comic spin-off, not an edition) -- strips an unclosed
    trailing parenthetical (`Saiyuki (Enix Edition`) and a bare trailing "volumes" / "volume
    list" heading (`Gunsmith Cats Burst volumes`); the chapter / nested-series / quote guards
    stand (`The Kindaichi Case Files (File series (27 volumes/19 files)` stays). Measured
    against round 1: 3 new (Dance in the Vampire Bund (Omnibus) -> 37627, Freezing (Part 2:
    Volumes 15-29) -> 35911, Highschool of the Dead (English omnibus volumes) -> 30669), 0
    changed, 0 lost; ~20 of the new stripped terms were never searched (a live run settles them). The catalogue names sibling
    editions after Wikipedia's headings ("Inuyasha (VizBig edition)", "Ranma ½ (2014 English
    release (2-in-1 Edition)"), and AniList has one entry for the work. It is ranked like an
    ALIAS (R3, no fallback tiers), not like the name: stripping can drop content, and the
    R3 failure is exactly what it would do -- "Sailor Moon (Shinsōban short stories)", 2
    volumes, bound the 18-volume serial through the bare "Sailor Moon" under R2 (its own
    entry is "Sailor Moon Short Stories"). Measured: 9 new, each the id a sibling edition
    of the same line already carries; the own-name reading added Jiraishin and that wrong
    Sailor Moon bind. Then the line's aliases -- EVERY alias (series_alias in stored order, one per normalized form, Wikipedia
    list-article names skipped), each ranked against the page the name search already fetched
    at no cost, and a fresh search only for the first ALIAS_LIMIT = 3 that miss that page,
    ranked against its own page (Mangarr's AniListService.FindSeries: aliases are walked, only
    SEARCHES are capped). There is no fuzzy pass: the fallback tiers each demand an exact
    title or an exact volume count, and a line none of them reaches stays NULL for Mangarr's
    own ranked search at add time. A guess here would be pinned by every future add.
  * post-walk tiers (round 2, 2026-09-24; post_walk()): only for a line STILL unbound after the whole
    walk above, and only over the pages the walk already fetched -- the name page, then every page a
    retry term searched (de-slugged form, R6, aliases), each with the own-name flag it was searched
    under. Zero new queries, and never ahead of an earlier tier: a line any tier above bound is
    skipped. Catalogue-side only -- Mangarr does not mirror them; it reads the id this step writes.
    Tried in order V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V4, the first hit binds:
    - V1 prefix (via 'prefix'): the name is the head of AniList's full title ("Even Dogs Go to Other
      Worlds" is "...: Life in Another World with My Beloved Hound"). Gate: the line has >= 3
      volumes; a BARE name only (no `(`, no ` (` / `: ` / ` - ` / ` / ` cut); own-name pages only; the
      term's key >= 6 characters; nothing on the page title-equals the term (exact or R7, rejected
      and ONE_SHOT candidates included). Exactly ONE non-ONE_SHOT candidate has a title / synonym
      whose words start with the term's words plus a word boundary -- counted BEFORE the volume rule
      (Kase-san: "Kase-san and..." (5 vols) and "Kase-san and Yamada" both start so, and filtering
      the 5 out first would bind Yamada) -- and it passes pick()'s volume rule with `volumes` null
      or >= the line's (Your Name's "Another Side: Earthbound", 1 vol, never). Shino & Ren (1-vol
      LN) -> "Shino & Ren: Future" is what the gate keeps out
    - V2 arc (via 'arc'): the name has a real arc part (arc_parts(): the name after its first cut,
      parentheses dropped; an R6 edition qualifier is not one), base and arc keys each >= 4, and
      exactly ONE candidate passing the volume rule has a title / synonym containing BOTH keys with
      `volumes` equal to the line's count or to its origin line's (Umineko's English 3-volume
      "Alliance of the Golden Witch" is AniList's 6-volume Episode 4, the JP line's 6). Base-only
      containment never binds: without the arc the Jiraishin line bound "Jiraishin Diablo" (3 = 3)
      and Index NT bound Index (22 = the JP line's 22)
    - V3 amp (via 'amp'): an equality tier like R7 with '&' read as 'and' ("Sword Art Online: Kiss &
      Fly" = "...: Kiss and Fly"), for a term that has either. PRIMARY titles only -- the one synonym
      match measured was the doubtful Shino & Ren -> "Shino & Ren: Future" (synonym "Shino and
      Ren") -- never beside a candidate whose title exactly key-equals the term (rejected ones
      included), volume rule kept, ties to popularity
    - V4 origin (via 'origin'): on a RETRY term's page (never the name page), exactly one non-
      ONE_SHOT candidate key-equals the term, was rejected only by the 4x ceiling (`volumes` > 4x
      the line's) and has `volumes` equal to the origin line's count -- a short English run of the
      full Japanese serial, which R4 cannot reach off the name page (Jiraishin, Tokyopop, 3 vols ->
      30379 "Jiraishin", 19 = the JP line's 19; Crayon Shin-chan CMX 11 -> 32435, 50). Gate: the
      line has >= 3 volumes (Angel Beats! (Related media), 1 vol, bound Heaven's Door without it)
    Measured (export/replay_anilist.py --base main on opentome-2026-09-24): 52 new binds -- V1 26,
    V2 19, V3 5, V4 2 -- 0 changed, 0 lost; no new id is another work's EN line's, no two share one.

KR/CN WORKS WITHOUT AN ENGLISH COMIC LINE (the lift, 2026-10-01; krcn_works() / resolve_krcn()): one search set
per library work (meta krcn_ids.works) with no English comic line, over its is_main manhwa / manhua lines (FR
first: the anchor), each search filtered by AniList `countryOfOrigin` -- KR for manhwa; CN, then TW, for
manhua -- in families of their own in the cache key (krcn-KR, krcn-CN, krcn-TW), so a term searched for a
manhwa never reads a manhua or a Japanese page. Terms in order: each main line's name with its de-slugged
form and R6 retry; the native title, then the romanized one (series_alias official / romanized, ko / zh);
then up to ALIAS_LIMIT aliases. The first term that binds wins, and its id goes to EVERY main comic line of
the work still without one. Equality tiers only (primary / synonym with R1, R7) and V3; R2, R4, R5, V1, V2
are off (a generic French or German name would otherwise bind a larger serial on its title alone: the 4x
ceiling holds for a 1-2 volume line too, on every term); V4 needs an origin line these works do not have.
Every binding goes to build/krcn-anilist-bindings.tsv for a full read.
`--krcn-duplicates` (after the pins) writes the AniList-id collisions of works created in this build into
build/krcn-duplicates.tsv (the gate in export/test_artifact.py reads it).

DISPLAY ONLY (2026-09-24, `--display`, after the pins): series.display_anilist_id / _via give a
line the rules leave NULL a cover / synopsis source -- its bound parent line's id ('parent') or
the manga-family entry of a novel AniList lists only as an adaptation ('medium'). Never a
binding and never read by Mangarr; see display().

Polite by construction: one request per MIN_INTERVAL, up to BATCH searches per request as
GraphQL aliases, every search cached on disk per (term, family) under .cache/anilist/ so a
rebuild re-runs with zero network for every name already seen. Idempotent: only rows whose
anilist_id IS NULL are considered, and only resolved ones are written. Clean room: AniList
is a lookup-key source here (an id, and with --covers a cover URL) -- no title, synonym or
description ever enters the artifact.
