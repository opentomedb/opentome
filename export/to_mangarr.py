"""Export OpenTome -> a Mangarr-shaped artifact (drop-in for manga-metadata.sqlite).

Mangarr's `series` table is already one row per RELEASE LINE, which is the same
model OpenTome converged on independently, so the mapping is close to direct:

    opentome.release_line  ->  series
    opentome.volume        ->  volumes
    opentome.work_title    ->  series_alias      (localized-title matching)
    opentome.composition   ->  volumes.composition   (contains='volume' ONLY)

Two constraints come from the C# models, not from SQLite:

  * GcdSeries.GcdSeriesId is `int`  -> series ids must be stable INTEGERS.
    They are hash-derived and recorded in `id_map`, so a rebuild reuses existing
    ids and only new lines get new ones. Sequential numbering was rejected: it
    renumbers everything after an insertion, which the ID contract forbids.

  * GcdVolume.VolumeNumber is `int` -> fractional (7.5) and label volumes
    (SP, Ex3, Side Story) cannot be represented. They are NOT dropped silently:
    they go to `volumes_special`, which today's C# ignores and a later version
    can read, and the count is written to `meta`.

Three lessons from the first export, each measured against the live library
(docs/cleanup-v2.md):

  * `composition` means "the ORIGINAL volumes this volume contains" to the C#
    (an omnibus list). The first export wrote CHAPTER lists into it, which
    flagged every well-documented main line as an omnibus and made Mangarr
    prefer spin-offs over main lines (Attack on Titan -> "Before the Fall").
    Chapters now go to their own column; composition carries volumes only.
  * Work-level titles were attached as aliases to EVERY line of the work, so
    "Attack on Titan" answered 43 series. Only a work's MAIN line per market
    carries the work's titles; sub-lines carry their own name.
  * Year- and month-precision dates were emitted as bare '2019' / '2019-04',
    which .NET parses as 1 January / 1 April. Only day-precision dates are
    emitted as `release_date`; the coarse value and its precision travel in
    separate columns the C# can adopt later.
