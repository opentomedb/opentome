# Every published build gets its own release, tagged with the artifact's
# version label (opentome-YYYY-MM-DD): the artifact, version.json and the
# AniList report -- one release per build; a re-run replaces its assets. The
# alias tag (`metadata`, TAG) is what Mangarr polls; it is re-pointed by
# uploading the same artifact + manifest to it with --clobber.
# ROLLBACK_TO downloads an earlier build's two files and uploads them to the
# alias the same way -- every install downgrades on its next check, because the
# updater compares the date label in version.json. Nothing else is touched.
# A rollback past a release that published id redirects UN-publishes them (ids consumers already
# stored stop resolving) -- it needs Nick's explicit go-ahead (docs/carried-ids.md).
#
# Mangarr's MetadataUpdateService fetches version.json from the release, compares
# `gcd_dump` against the artifact it already has (IsNewer parses the date out of
# either label), downloads `artifact_url`, verifies sha256, checks the file opens
# as SQLite carrying that same `gcd_dump`, then swaps it in atomically.
#
# Auth: `gh` reads GH_TOKEN on its own (CI passes the fine-grained PAT that way);
# without it the logged-in `gh` on the workstation is used.
