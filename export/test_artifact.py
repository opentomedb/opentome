"""Contract tests for the exported Mangarr artifact.

Run automatically by tier0/rebuild_all.sh. Each rule encodes something the C#
consumer assumes and the first export violated silently while every unit test
on both sides stayed green (docs/cleanup-v2.md):

  * composition = ORIGINAL volume numbers this volume contains; a series is
    omnibus iff some volume contains >1 of them
  * volume_count = rows a consumer can read (Mangarr creates Books 1..N)
  * release_date is day precision or NULL (never '2019' -> 1 January)
  * no wiki markup in names, aliases or publishers
  * no English/French series with zero data
