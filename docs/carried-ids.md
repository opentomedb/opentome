# Carried ids — every published id keeps resolving (2026-09-25)

Status: built on branch `alias-fix` (not merged, not published). Code: `tier0/carried_ids.py`,
tests `tier0/test_carried_ids.py` (stage 0), gate `export/test_artifact.py` `run_ids`. The contract
it serves is `docs/id-scheme.md`; the German-only mechanism it generalises is
`tier0/build_dnb.py` `redirects()` (`docs/dnb-design.md`, "Redirects").

## Why

Ids hash natural keys (`schema/load.py`): a work is `w_<hash(identity key or title)>`, a line
`rl_<hash(work, medium, market, line name)>`, a volume `v_<hash(line, number)>`. A corrected fact
that feeds one of those keys issues new ids. Until this round only German ids had a redirect
writer, and the carried-id gate checked only German ids, so a re-key anywhere else would have
shipped green and orphaned every consumer that stored the old id. The round that exposed it:
`work_title()` read "Liste des chapitres des Gouttes de Dieu" as "s Gouttes de Dieu"; fixing it
re-keys the Kindaichi 1re / 2e partie lines (their names embed the title) and folds the French
Gouttes de Dieu work into Drops of God (the work-identity pass unions articles by title).

## Where it runs (`tier0/rebuild_all.sh`)

Both stages read the carried artifact, `ID_CARRY` = the last published `manga-metadata.sqlite`
(CI downloads it in "restore id carry"; locally it is `build/manga-metadata.sqlite`). With no
carry they do nothing.

- **4c. merged works** — `carried_ids.py merge`, after the enrichment, before clean.
- **7b. redirects** — `carried_ids.py redirect`, after the audit, before the export, so the
  export's integer carry sees the rows.

## No carry: fail in CI, unless the cold start is deliberate

Without a carry every integer is re-issued and nothing is redirected, so a missed download must
never ship. In CI (`OPENTOME_CI=1`, set by `catalogue.yml`, or `CI=true`) a missing carry fails
`catalogue.yml`'s "restore id carry" step, `tier0/rebuild_all.sh` (before stage 0) and both
`carried_ids.py` stages. **`OPENTOME_COLD_START=1`** (the workflow's `cold_start` dispatch input)
is the one exception: the very first build, or a rebuild after the published artifact itself is
gone. Outside CI a missing carry only warns.

The export writes `meta.carried_from` = the carry's `gcd_dump (generated_at)` (`cold-start` under
the flag) and `meta.carried_sha256` = the carry file's sha256. A real publish
(`PUBLISH=1 export/publish.sh`) refuses:
- an artifact without `carried_from`, unless `OPENTOME_COLD_START=1`;
- a `cold-start` artifact, unless `OPENTOME_COLD_START=1` is set at publish time too;
- a carried artifact unless `CARRY_SHA256` equals its `carried_sha256`, i.e. it was built against
  the release it would replace. CI passes the sha of the file its "restore id carry" step
  downloaded (`build/carry.sha256`). **Local rule:** a workstation publish must set
  `CARRY_SHA256` by hand to the live release's `version.json` `sha256`; publish.sh makes no
  network read of its own, so without it the publish is refused -- a build carried from a stale
  `build/manga-metadata.sqlite` can never replace the live artifact.
The dry run only reports these.

**Rollback.** `ROLLBACK_TO` past a release that published id redirects un-publishes them: ids
consumers already stored stop resolving. It needs Nick's explicit go-ahead.

## 4c. An absorbed work's duplicate lines

A work the carry published that is now part of another work brings its lines along, re-keyed
under the survivor. Where a re-keyed line is the same edition as one of the survivor's
**published** lines it is merged into that line:

- same edition = same market and medium, and a strict majority of the smaller line's ISBNs
  shared; when either line has no ISBNs, a strict majority of its dated volumes (number + date,
  at least two);
- the published line keeps its id, its own volumes and their claims byte for byte; a volume
  number it lacks moves over as `v_<hash(line, number)>`; the duplicate's other volumes are
  dropped with their claims; every reference follows (composition volume and ref line, arc
  parent, claims, resolution, override, external ids, `dnb_member`, `dnb_line`);
- the lines in other markets that found the duplicate as their origin by line name get a derived
  `origin_line` claim (source `opentome`) naming the survivor — without it the FR "Mariage" line
  fell back to the JP main line and exported `ongoing` instead of `completed` (measured).

**Scope.** Only a line the carry does not have, in a work that absorbed another — in this build,
or through a carried `work` redirect (the duplicate comes back on every build, so the merge must
too) — and only when the line's evidence also matches one of the **absorbed** work's own
published lines: a plain re-key of a line the survivor already had stays a re-key (7b), even
beside a same-edition twin. The export records each merge as `meta.merged_lines` ([duplicate
line id, survivor] pairs, not a consumer field); a later build, whose carry no longer holds the
absorbed work's lines, merges the same duplicate id into the same survivor by that record. Today's catalogue has **496** same-work same-edition line pairs whose ids are all published
(JoJo printings, "Tomes 31 à aujourd'hui" tails, EN/FR-article JP twins); merging those would
retire hundreds of consumer-held ids and is a separate decision.

**Why after the enrichment.** openBD is cached by whole batches of 80 sorted JP ISBNs. The first
build of this round merged at stage 3a and dropped one distinct JP ISBN; every later batch became
a new URL — 363 of 755 batch URLs uncached — and, offline, 42,981 openBD date claims disappeared
(`release_date_type` moved on 42,464 volumes). With network it would have been a ~360-request
burst. After the enrichment the batches see the same ISBN set.

## 7b. Redirects

1. The carry's own `id_redirect` rows are re-read (stage 3e already re-reads them too), so a
   redirect survives every later build; the export collapses chains. A chain stops at the first
   id present in this build (7b and the export alike), and a row whose **old** id is present
   again -- a re-key reverted ("s X" -> "Les X" -> "s X") -- is stale: 7b drops and reports it,
   the export never writes it. Kept, it would send a live id elsewhere and close a cycle.
2. A carried **work** this build lost → the present work holding a strict majority of its
   volumes' ISBNs; else the work its lines' successors belong to. Reason `duplicate_merge` when
   that work was published, else `correction`.
3. A carried **line** this build lost → in its (successor) work, same market + medium: the line
   holding a strict majority of its ISBNs; else a strict majority of its dated volumes; then the same ISBN test market-wide (a
   line that moved to another work); then, in its work and market, a line of ANOTHER medium by the
   same two tests (its medium changed: a heading that names a medium, or stage 4b2's Korean / Chinese
   comic medium -- heading cleanup, 2026-09-29); else the work's main line of that market + medium, reason
   `retired`. Reason `duplicate_merge` when the successor was published, else `correction`.
4. A carried **volume** this build lost → the one volume of its line's successor holding its ISBN
   (unique there: the English Drops of God article repeats vol 23's ISBN on vol 25, so that ISBN
   decides nothing); else the volume of the same number there; else the one volume of its market
   with its ISBN; else the successor **line**, reason `retired`. When the line itself was
   **retired** (fell back to the work's main line) numbers are never used -- the main line's vol 1
   is a different book than an arc's vol 1 -- only a unique ISBN in the market, else `retired`
   to the line. A volume redirected to a line is never labelled `correction`.
5. **Ties.** Every "strict majority" above is ordered by (votes, id), never by dict or set order
   (which follows the hash seed). A tie at the top goes to the one candidate that is **new** in
   this build, when exactly one is: a line re-keyed beside a published same-edition twin ties
   with it on every ISBN (456 of the catalogue's 496 same-edition pairs nest), and the renamed
   line is the successor. Any other tie is **ambiguous**: no row, the id is reported
   (`AMBIGUOUS ...`, `meta` `carried:redirects`) and is an orphan, so the gate fails and a
   person decides. 4c likewise does not merge a line that
   two published lines match equally.
6. Lines and volumes of a work in `corrections/excluded.json` are retired on purpose and get no
   row — an excluded work has no successor. Anything else without a present target is an
   orphan: printed, written to `meta` `carried:redirects`, and the gate fails.

Ids that stage 3e (DNB) already redirected are left as they are. A redirect's target is always
an id present in the catalogue at 7b.

The export (`export/to_mangarr.py`) counts work ids (`series.tome_work_id`) as present, so a
work redirect reaches the artifact (`entity='work'`, integers NULL). A re-keyed line with no
integer of its own takes the old line's integer (a consumer's stored `gcd_series_id` keeps
working); a merged line's integer resolves through `old_series_id -> new_series_id` and stays
reserved in `id_map` (kind `retired`).

## The gate (`export/test_artifact.py` `run_ids`, stage 8c)

- every work, line and volume id of the carry, **every market** -- and every id the carry's own
  `id_redirect` already resolved -- is present or resolves through the artifact's `id_redirect`
  to an id that is; ids of works in `meta.excluded_works` are exempt;
- unchanged: more than `MAX_RETIRED_DE_VOLUMES` = 25 carried German volumes gone fails;
- new: more than `MAX_RETIRED_VOLUMES` = 100 carried volumes, or more than `MAX_RETIRED_LINES` =
  10 carried lines, **retired** in one build, any market, fails — retired = no longer resolving
  to an id of its own kind, or reason `retired`, or not resolving; ids a re-key or a merge moved
  do not count; a work listed in this build's `excluded.json` does not count;
- new: more than `MAX_MOVED_IDS` = 500 carried ids moved (re-keyed or merged) in one build fails,
  so a mass re-key cannot ship green because every id found a successor; the count is printed;
- every `id_redirect` target is in the artifact (works included).
- every carried integer (`series.gcd_series_id`, and the carry's own `id_redirect.old_series_id`) is
  still a series or an `id_redirect.old_series_id` here (excluded works exempt).

## Measured (offline rebuild of the branch against the published `opentome-2026-09-25`)

The fix changes 4 of 9,668 distinct corpus / identity names (all "des"; no "du" occurs). Ids:
13 lines, 247 volumes and 1 work leave the artifact; all 261 are redirected, 0 retired, 0
orphans. Kindaichi 1re / 2e partie: 8 lines / 105 volumes re-keyed (`correction`), same data,
same integers. Gouttes de Dieu: `w_2e7699a81cd4` → `w_0153b28bb30b` (`duplicate_merge`); its
3 JP lines (72 volumes) merge into Drops of God's published JP lines (`duplicate_merge`, by
number); its 2 FR lines (70 volumes) re-key under Drops of God (`correction`, same integers).
Nothing else moved: every id present in both builds has identical series and volume columns;
the only other change is 3 Kindaichi Case Files main lines trading the alias "s Enquêtes de
Kindaichi" for "Les Enquêtes de Kindaichi". A second build against the new artifact: 0 new ids,
0 changed, the 261 rows identical, and the gate re-checks those 261 old ids (0 lost). The same stages on the unfixed corpus: 0 merges, 0 redirects,
an artifact identical to main's.
