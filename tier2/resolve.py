"""Resolve competing claims into one value per field, with a confidence.

This is the feature that distinguishes the catalogue from a scrape. A consumer
(Mangarr, Kavita) must be able to auto-accept above a threshold and queue the
rest -- which is the direct fix for the silent-wrong-match class of bug.

The calibration rule is EMPIRICAL, from tier-1 cross-verification (docs/):
49 of 50 cross-source date disagreements were exact multiples of 7 days, 45 in
the same direction. Those are two sources answering different questions
(publication date vs retail on-sale date), not one being wrong. A magnitude
bound is required though: two different *editions* both shipping on a Tuesday
also differ by a multiple of 7, so large week-multiples mean wrong edition or
wrong release line, not date semantics.
