"""Apply hand-checked corrections. See `corrections/README.md`.

Two things make this different from editing the database by hand, which is what
it replaces:

  * **It survives a rebuild.** The catalogue is rebuilt from scratch into a new
    file, so any value typed into the old one is gone. A correction is applied
    as a pipeline stage, every time.
  * **It is checked.** A correction whose target no longer exists fails the
    build instead of silently doing nothing -- this project's recurring bug is
    an operation that reports success and changes nothing.

Volume corrections are written TWICE, on purpose: to `override` (where
`tier2/resolve.py` ranks them above every source, so the confidence layer
reports `manual_override` and the provenance is honest) and onto the `volume`
row (which is what the exporter actually reads). Writing only one of the two
produces a correction that is either invisible to consumers or invisible to the
audit trail.

`--check [DIR] [--artifact PATH]` is the pull-request check: the same
validation, resolved against a PUBLISHED artifact (manga-metadata.sqlite) instead
of the pipeline database, so a contributor and CI can run it with nothing but
the repository and one download. It writes nothing.

`--anilist ARTIFACT` is stage 8a's second half: it writes corrections/anilist.json's
hand-checked AniList ids onto the exported artifact, after export/resolve_anilist.py.
