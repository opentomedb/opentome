"""Per-volume cover URLs, keyed by the edition's ISBN. Cache only -- zero requests.

The rule that makes a cover right: it is looked up by the ISBN of the exact
edition, never by a title search. A title search returns *a* cover for *some*
edition of *something* with that name, which is how a volume ends up wearing
another volume's face. Both sources below are queried by ISBN and both were
already fetched for date/page enrichment, so every URL here comes from the
disk cache.

  Open Library `api/books?bibkeys=ISBN:…&jscmd=data`  -> rec.cover.large   (EN, FR)
  openBD      `v1/get?isbn=…`                          -> summary.cover       (JP)

Only a URL and its source are stored -- never the image. Mangarr fetches at
display time into its own cache; nothing is hosted. A record without a cover
yields no claim. One placeholder does exist: Open Library sometimes answers with a
cover whose id is -1 (".../b/id/-1-L.jpg" -- a removed or never-uploaded cover), which
redirects to a 404 on archive.org (15 volumes in opentome-2026-09-24, e.g. Kaiju No. 8
Relax, Haikyu!!). `ol_cover_ok` drops any Open Library cover id that isn't positive;
openBD leaves `cover` empty when it has none.
