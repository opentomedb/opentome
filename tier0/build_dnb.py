"""Stage 3e: the German market from the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (docs/dnb-design.md).

    python3 tier0/build_dnb.py build/opentome.db [carry-artifact]

German Wikipedia documents ~35 manga lines with volume tables (docs/german-market.md);
legal deposit puts every German print volume in DNB, CC0. This stage turns DNB's
Japanese-origin print manga and light novels into DE release lines:

  1. records     tier0/dnb_enumerate.py (three channels, cached; zero network on a rerun)
  2. select      Japanese origin; manga or light novel (tier0/dnb_marc.classify); print
                 only (the queries say bbg=A*); bundles, box sets, artbooks, guides and
                 combined "1 - 3" records are not volumes in v1
  3. volumes     ISBN twins merged (a pre-publication record + the deposit copy, or a
                 special edition sharing the ISBN); an ISBN on records with DIFFERENT
                 volume numbers is a box-set ISBN and is dropped from all of them
  4. lines       parent IDN (773$w); else folded series + publisher (+ medium, edition);
                 else folded bare title + publisher; series/title clusters fold into the
                 parent line of the same folded name + publisher + edition. Line id =
                 hash of 'dnb:<parent IDN>' / 'dnb:<lowest member IDN>' -- source data
                 only, so relinking a line to another work never re-keys it
  5. merge       with the German Wikipedia lines: an ISBN shared with a Wikipedia volume
                 attaches to that volume (it gains dnb claims); a DNB line holding the
                 majority of a Wikipedia line's shared ISBNs merges into it and keeps its
                 rl_ id; a second such DNB line is a sibling (same work, own id); a DNB
                 line sharing ISBNs with several Wikipedia lines merges into the one it
                 shares most with, and the others are left as they are
  6. link        tier0/dnb_link.py, title + author only. Merged/sibling lines are the
                 ground truth: the linker runs on them too, and a wrong link there fails
                 export/test_artifact.py
  7. load        high/medium links and ISBN siblings become release lines; low and
                 ambiguous go to build/dnb-review.tsv; the rest stay in the staging tables
  8. redirects   a German line id in the carried artifact that this build no longer has
                 is redirected (id_redirect) to the line now holding most of its ISBNs

Dates (decision 2): 008 year -> 'published', precision 'year', from any deposited
record; an announcement-only volume (every record at leader/17 = '8') takes its 263
planned month as 'projected', precision 'month' -- and when its year is after the
current year it is held back altogether (2027-2030 placeholders, likely cancellations).
Every claim: source 'dnb', licence 'cc0', source_url https://d-nb.info/<IDN>. No
covers, no blurbs (856 is never read).
