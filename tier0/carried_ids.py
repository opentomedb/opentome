"""Carried ids: every id the last published artifact holds keeps resolving (docs/id-scheme.md,
docs/carried-ids.md).

    python3 tier0/carried_ids.py merge    build/opentome.db [carry-artifact]   # stage 4c
    python3 tier0/carried_ids.py redirect build/opentome.db [carry-artifact]   # stage 7b

The carried artifact is rebuild_all.sh's ID_CARRY: the last published manga-metadata.sqlite (CI
downloads it before the rebuild). Ids hash natural keys (schema/load.py), so a corrected fact
that feeds a key -- a work title, a line name -- issues new ids. The contract says the old ones
resolve forever through id_redirect. Two stages keep it, for any market, any entity, any cause:

  merge (4c, after the enrichment, before clean / corrections / resolve)
      [after the enrichment because openBD is cached by whole 80-ISBN batches of the sorted JP
      ISBNs: a merge that drops one ISBN before it shifts every later batch to an uncached URL
      (measured on the Gouttes merge: 363 of 755) -- a request burst, or, offline, dates lost]
      A work the carried artifact published that this build folded into another work (the
      work-identity pass unions articles by title, so a title fix can join two articles)
      brings its lines along, re-keyed under the surviving work. Where such a re-keyed line
      is the SAME edition as one of the survivor's carried lines -- same market and medium,
      a strict majority of the smaller line's ISBNs shared, or, when either has no ISBNs, of
      its dated volumes (number + date) -- it is merged into that carried line, but only when
      its evidence also matches one of the ABSORBED work's own published lines (a plain re-key
      of a line the survivor already had stays a re-key, even beside a same-edition twin): the
      carried line survives byte for byte, a volume number it lacks moves over (re-keyed by number),
      the rest are dropped with their claims. Scope: only the lines of a work that absorbed
      another (this build, or a carried `work` redirect -- the duplicate comes back on every
      build; later builds merge it by the carry's meta.merged_lines, [duplicate line id,
      survivor] pairs the export writes, because the absorbed work's lines are no longer in
      the carry to compare with), and only a line the carried artifact does not have. A line both artifacts have
      is never merged here: today's catalogue has ~500 same-work same-edition pairs (JoJo
      printings, "Tomes 31 à aujourd'hui" tails) whose ids are published.

  redirect (7b, after the audit, before the export)
      1. the carried artifact's own id_redirect rows are re-read, so a redirect survives
         every later build (chains collapse at export, stopping at the first id present in
         this build); a row whose OLD id is present again (a reverted re-key) is dropped and
         reported -- it would point a live id away, and close a cycle with the new redirect;
      1b. a carried line a round C merge (stage 4c2, meta roundc:merged, verdict extend or
         duplicate) folded away -> its target line, and each of its carried volumes -> the
         target's volume of the same number (reason duplicate_merge), before any vote: the
         decision is on record, and a line without ISBNs would tie or retire below;
      2. a carried WORK this build lost -> the work now holding a strict majority of its
         volumes' ISBNs (reason duplicate_merge when that work was published, else
         correction), else the work its lines went to;
      3. a carried LINE this build lost -> in its (successor) work, same market + medium, the
         line holding a strict majority of its ISBNs, else of its dated volumes; then the same
         ISBN test market-wide (a line re-attached to another work); then its work and market in
         ANOTHER medium by the same two tests (its medium changed: a heading that names a medium,
         stage 4b2's comic medium); else the work's main
         line of that market + medium (reason retired). Two candidates tied at the top: the
         one NEW in this build wins when exactly one is (a re-key beside its published twin);
         otherwise AMBIGUOUS at every step: reported as an orphan (the gate fails);
      4. a carried VOLUME this build lost -> the one volume of its line's successor with its
         ISBN, else the volume of the same number there, else the one volume of its market with
         its ISBN, else the successor LINE (reason retired: the volume is gone, the id still
         resolves to where it belonged). When the LINE was retired (it fell back to its work's
         main line), numbers mean nothing -- the main line's vol 1 is another book -- so only a
         unique ISBN in the market claims it; else it retires to the line.
      Lines and volumes of works in corrections/excluded.json are retired on purpose and get
      no row (an excluded work has no successor). Anything else left without a present
      target is an orphan: reported here, and export/test_artifact.py run_ids fails on it.
      Ids 3e (build_dnb.redirects) already redirected are left as they are.
