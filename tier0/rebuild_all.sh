# Full rebuild pipeline, in dependency order. Every stage is cache-backed, so a
# complete re-run costs minutes rather than hours and zero additional network.
#
#   0. unit tests      parser / collapse / resolve / dnb / carried ids / krcn -- a rebuild on a
#                      broken parser is worse than no rebuild
#   1. work identity   langlinks -> cross-language work classes  (MUST precede build)
#   2. corpus en+fr    Wikipedia volume-list templates
#   3. corpus de       wikitables, discovered via langlinks
#   3b. official titles main-article + redirect names (the titles folders use)
#   3c. main articles  status / first / last / publishers / people / genres from the main
#   3d. relations      sequel / spin-off / adaptation from titles and shared main articles
#                      article's infobox (one request per work, cached)
#   3e. dnb            the German market from the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (CC0): print
#                      manga / light novels of Japanese origin, ISBN-merged into the German
#                      Wikipedia lines, linked to works by title + author (high/medium ship,
#                      low/ambiguous -> build/dnb-review.tsv). ~390 SRU requests at >= 3 s
#                      on a cold cache (~20 min), zero on a warm one, ~62 a week with
#                      DNB_REFRESH_DAYS set (CI) (tier0/build_dnb.py)
#   3f. krcn           Korean / Chinese print editions (docs/krcn-design.md): DNB spo=kor/chi (German),
#                      BnF publisher channels (French), Library of Congress DLC-created records (English;
#                      the canary first). Lines link to existing works, merge by ISBN, cluster across
#                      markets; works are created from a comic line in any market (novels alone:
#                      build/krcn-held.tsv; duplicate candidates: build/krcn-duplicates.tsv),
#                      ids adopted before 4c / 7b. Cold: DNB ~100, LoC ~110-160, BnF ~11 requests at >= 3 s;
#                      warm: 1 (the LoC canary); CI: LOC/BNF_REFRESH_DAYS=28 (tier0/build_krcn.py)
#   4b. covers         ISBN-keyed cover URLs from the cached openBD /
#                      Open Library responses -- zero requests
#   4. enrichment      openBD (JP) / Open Library (EN, FR) / BnF (FR)
#   4b2. comic medium  a 'manga' line of a Korean / Chinese work (origin market KR -> manhwa, CN / TW ->
#                      manhua: the export's pick_origin, to_mangarr.origin_markets) is retagged in place; a
#                      line that becomes the same line as another (work, market, medium, name) folds into it
#                      and 7b redirects it; a library / corrected line or a pair of editions is reported,
#                      never folded (tier0/comic_medium.py). After 3f and the enrichment, before 4c / 5b
#   4c. merged works   a published work this build folded into another (a title fix can
#                      union two articles) must not leave the survivor two lines for one
#                      edition: its re-keyed lines that repeat one of the survivor's published
#                      lines (same market + medium, most ISBNs shared) merge into that line
#                      (tier0/carried_ids.py merge; the ids are redirected at 7b). AFTER the
#                      enrichment: openBD caches whole 80-ISBN batches of the sorted JP ISBNs,
#                      so a merge that drops one ISBN before it re-keys every later batch
#                      (measured: 363 of 755 batch URLs) -- a request burst, or dates lost offline
#   5. clean           date_type, Jan-1 precision, malformed ISBNs
#   5b. corrections    hand-checked values (corrections/), applied after clean
#                      so clean cannot undo them and before resolve so the
#                      confidence layer reports them as manual_override
#   6. resolve         claims -> values + confidence
#   7. audit           report remaining defects -- EXITS NON-ZERO on any defect
#   7b. redirects      every id of the carried (last published) artifact this build no longer
#                      has -> id_redirect to its successor, any market, work / line / volume
#                      (tier0/carried_ids.py; docs/carried-ids.md); the export collapses chains
#                      and 8c fails on any carried id left without a present target
#   8. export          Mangarr-shaped artifact (+ curated aliases, + id carry)
#   8a. anilist ids   series.anilist_id for English lines and for the KR/CN works without an English
#                      comic line (export/resolve_anilist.py, cached; build/krcn-anilist-bindings.tsv), then
#                      corrections/anilist.json's hand-checked ids over the resolver's pick, then the
#                      AniList-id collisions of works created in this build (build/krcn-duplicates.tsv), then
#                      the DISPLAY-ONLY fallback (display_anilist_id -- never a binding) for lines
#                      still NULL, then build/anilist-covers.json for the final ids (pinned and
#                      display ids included)
#   8c. contract       export/test_artifact.py on the new artifact, plus the German (DNB)
#                      rules that need the catalogue's provenance (cc0, dates, linker fixture)
#   8d. measure gate   replay Mangarr's series pick over the committed library snapshot
#                      (export/fixtures/library.json) -- EXITS NON-ZERO on a coverage
#                      failure (an owned volume the picked line lacks); then the German
#                      floors (lines, volumes, date / page coverage, link rate, same ids on
#                      reload); log in build/measure.log
#
# The catalogue is built into a FRESH database and renamed over the old one at
# the end. Building on top of the existing file skipped every article already
# marked done, so a parser fix changed nothing and the run still printed
