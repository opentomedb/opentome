"""DNB SRU client: serial, throttled across processes, disk-cached, polite.

The Deutsche Nationalbibliothek's bibliographic data is CC0 1.0
(https://www.dnb.de/businessmodel.html, 17.12.2024). This module only fetches;
tier0/dnb_marc.py parses and tier0/build_dnb.py builds lines from what it returns.

Politeness (docs/dnb-design.md "Access"): DNB documents no rate limit, but the
2026-09-24 spike was answered with HTTP 429 after ~46 requests at ~1.7 s spacing
(one pair < 1 s apart across two processes). So:

  * >= 3 s between requests ACROSS PROCESSES -- the time of the last request lives
    in a lock-guarded stamp file, so two scripts started back to back cannot burst;
  * one 429/503 is answered by waiting out Retry-After (or 60 s); a SECOND one in
    the same run stops the run (DnbThrottled) instead of backing off for an hour --
    repeated refusals are DNB telling us to go away, and a human decides what next;
  * every live request is appended to build/dnb-netlog.tsv, so the request budget
    of a run is auditable after the fact;
  * responses are cached in .cache/ under the repo-wide sha256(url)[:32] + '.xml'
    key (tier1/enrich_more._fetch_xml), so a rerun costs zero requests.

DNB_OFFLINE=1 makes a cache miss an error instead of a request (tests, and proving a
rebuild is offline). DNB_REFRESH_DAYS=N is the opt-in freshness window: callers pass
`refresh=True` for slices that can still change (last year and later, the no-year
remainder), and those are refetched when their cached set is older than N days. Default
off: a rebuild is reproducible from the cache. A result set is cached whole or not at all
(search()); see DEGRADED below for what a refresh run does when DNB fails.
