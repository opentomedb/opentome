"""Link a DNB German release line to an existing OpenTome work -- by title and author only.

ISBNs are deliberately NOT a linking feature: German ISBNs appear nowhere else in the
catalogue except the ~35 German Wikipedia lines, and those are the linker's ground truth
(tier0/build_dnb.py measures the linker against them without ISBNs).

Keys (fold()): case, diacritics, macrons, ou/oo/uu, the particle wo -> o, DNB's non-sort
markers, and -- on the DNB side only -- a trailing volume number; each DNB title is
keyed both stripped and unstripped.

    DNB side      original titles (240, 246, 245$b '= ...'), the German title proper
                  (245$a), series statements WITH a $v (490/830; a 490 without $v is an
                  imprint collection: "Action", "Romance")
    OpenTome side primary_title; work_title official/romanized (incl. the German official
                  title); ja_romaji / ja_kanji claims; Wikipedia line_name claims (a line of
                  a work -- "Goblin Slayer: Year One" -- links to that work); aliases only as
                  a low tier (the alias table holds character and place names)

Tiers -- only high and medium are exported (decision 1, docs/dnb-design.md):

    high       an official key matches, and exactly one of the matching works shares an author
    medium     an official key matches exactly one work and one side has no creator data at
               all (both sides naming creators, none shared, is a title collision -> low);
               or (prefix) an ORIGINAL title's key of 10+ characters is the START of exactly
               one work's official key and that work shares an author (a truncated romaji).
               German and series titles never take the prefix path: "Detektiv Conan" is the
               start of every Conan spin-off's title
    low        alias-only matches, or an official key that is the start of the DNB key
               (the spin-off shape: "Goblin Slayer! Year one" -> Goblin Slayer) -- review.
               A spin-off whose series statement names the parent franchise ("Bungo Stray
               Dogs: dead apple") still links to the parent at high/medium: a German subtitle
               looks the same ("Hell Mode. Unterforderter Hardcore-Gamer ..."), and capping
               that shape sent three correct lines to review for none caught (2026-09-24)
    ambiguous  several works and nothing to choose between them -- review. When several
               works answer, the one whose title IS the line's own title proper is chosen
               (own-title): high with author evidence, else medium
    none       nothing matched
