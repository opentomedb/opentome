"""Enumerate the DNB records OpenTome ingests, through three channels (docs/dnb-design.md):

  1. `spo=jpn and bbg=A*`   print books whose 041$h original language is Japanese
                            (22,101 of them carry DDC 741.5 in the spike's count)
  2. manga imprints         `(vlg=TOKYOPOP or ...) and bbg=A* not spo=jpn` -- records the
                            spo index misses; build_dnb.py keeps only Japanese-origin ones
  3. parents                every 773$w set record not already seen, by `idn=` OR-batches

Channels 1 and 2 are sliced by publication year (`jhr`), so a result set is stable while
it is paged. Slices that can still change take part in the opt-in freshness window
(DNB_REFRESH_DAYS, tier0/dnb_sru.py): last year (legal deposit lags a median 120 days,
p90 293), the current year and later, the no-year remainder, and the parent batches.

Completeness is checked, not assumed, and the first full run (2026-09-24) showed why:
`jhr` is MULTI-valued (a record can carry several years: 25,933 slice hits for 25,270
records) and some records have none at all (7 in channel 1, 304 in channel 2). So each
channel also pages a `not jhr>0` remainder, and the DISTINCT records paged must equal the
unsliced numberOfRecords; every slice must yield as many distinct records as it announced.
On a refresh run the total is refetched too; a gap there means an older, frozen slice gained
a late record, and only the frozen slices whose count changed are re-paged.
