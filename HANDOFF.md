# HANDOFF — OpenTome

_Last updated: 2026-09-28_

## 2026-09-27 — branch `krcn`: Korean / Chinese editions (DNB, BnF, LoC)

Design: `docs/krcn-design.md` (spec + R1–R7 rulings), market doc: `docs/krcn-market.md`. Not
merged, not pushed, not published, no CI triggered -- Nick's gate (CI build-only first;
publish = standing OK after a green build-only run).

Done (design `docs/krcn-design.md`, results `docs/krcn-market.md`):
- Stages: **3f krcn** (Korean / Chinese print editions, after 3e dnb: DNB `spo=kor`/`spo=chi` +
  `IMPRINT_Q` split, BnF publisher channels, LoC DLC-created records; lines link to existing
  works, merge by ISBN, cluster across markets; works created only with an English line, the
  rest held; ids adopted before 4c/7b).
- New modules: `tier0/lib_sru.py` (the shared polite-SRU base: throttle, whole-set cache,
  netlog, `_OFFLINE`, degraded mode, canary hook), `tier0/loc_sru.py` (the R7 paging ladder:
  100→50→25, then slices; duplicate-position handling), `tier0/loc_marc.py` (LCCN, `$q`
  volumes, `263` YYMM, `008`, DLC/encoding-level, origin, comic/prose classification),
  `tier0/bnf_sru.py` / `tier0/bnf_unimarc.py` (BnF client + UNIMARC field map, 101 $c origin),
  `tier0/krcn_lines.py` (lines per source), `tier0/krcn_identity.py` (carry lookup, split/take
  rules), `tier0/build_krcn.py` (stage 3f itself), `tier0/krcn_replay.py` (jp-snapshot /
  jp-diff), `tier0/test_krcn.py` (stage 0).
- Changed: `tier0/dnb_link.py` (`fold()` keeps Hangul -- NFC after the combining-mark strip,
  U+AC00–D7A3 added, a 2-syllable minimum for Hangul-only keys; the KR/CN work set and the new
  JP out-of-scope test; the full-name author rule for KR/CN lines), `tier0/dnb_enumerate.py` /
  `tier0/dnb_sru.py` / `tier0/build_dnb.py` (the new channels, `DNB_MAX_REQUESTS`, the
  `IMPRINT_Q` split, P25 deferral to the JP round), `tier2/corrections.py` (`link_work`, R2),
  `tier2/resolve.py`, `schema/schema.sql` (`clean_claim` gains `us_gov_pd` -- the
  `krcn_line`/`krcn_member`/`loc_member` staging tables are `build_krcn.STAGING_DDL`, not
  schema.sql), `schema/load.py` (`LICENCE["loc"]`), `export/to_mangarr.py`
  / `export/test_to_mangarr.py` / `export/test_artifact.py` (the KR/CN contract rules of §13),
  `export/measure_library.py` (staged KR/CN floors), `export/publish.sh`, `tier1/enrich_more.py`
  / `tier1/covers.py` / `tier1/verify.py` (Open Library per-ISBN cache keys), LICENSE-DATA.md,
  `docs/id-scheme.md`, `corrections/README.md`.
- Fixtures: `export/fixtures/krcn_lines_pre.json` (the 54 existing KR/CN works' EN/FR/DE line
  ids + the 3 library-fixture lines), `export/fixtures/krcn_linker_labels.json` (`must_link`/
  `must_not_link`, plus `taken_ok`), `export/fixtures/krcn_new_works.json` (empty until C5).
- CI (this task): `LOC_REFRESH_DAYS`/`BNF_REFRESH_DAYS` = 28 on the weekly cron,
  `LOC_MAX_REQUESTS` = 260; a "LoC reachability" and a "BnF reachability" step, each a single
  probe that appends one line to `build/loc-netlog.tsv` / `bnf-netlog.tsv` (lib_sru's columns)
  and on failure sets `LOC_OFFLINE=1`/`BNF_OFFLINE=1` plus `LOC_UNREACHABLE=1`/`BNF_UNREACHABLE=1`
  rather than failing the job; the source cache is saved by a final `actions/cache/save` step
  gated on the `build/sources-complete.marker` marker (see Gotchas); the KR/CN files
  (`krcn-review.tsv`, `krcn-held.tsv`, `krcn-new-works.tsv`, `krcn-report.json`,
  `loc-report.json`, `loc-netlog.tsv`, `bnf-netlog.tsv`) added to the run's uploaded artifact.
- Docs: `docs/legal-position.md` (LoC row + the §105-inference note), README.md (LoC in the
  sources list; the Ize/Yen-heavy English-coverage sentence, R4), `docs/german-market.md`
  (a short pointer: KR/CN German lines are `krcn_line`, not `dnb_line`; the JP gates are
  unchanged), `docs/krcn-market.md` (new: sources, scope, keys/identity, R6, files, gates, the
  spike table, an empty "First build" section for C4).

Measured request counts (Tasks 7-9):
- **BnF (Task 7):** 11 live requests total (cap 20); a rerun made 0 (fully cached).
- **DNB `spo=kor`/`spo=chi` (Task 9):** 80 live requests, all HTTP 200 (netlog 454 → 534
  lines); reruns made 0 (fully cached). The 14 P25 parent sets that split across the JP and
  KR/CN rounds are deferred whole to the JP round (exactly as predicted); the set-level split
  itself is a follow-up left for Nick (see "Open for Nick" below).
- **LoC (Task 8): BLOCKED, not finished, not fully cached.** 140 of the 400-request cap used
  (5 probe + 16 run 1 + 102 run 2 + 17 run 3); the gateway closed the connection instantly on
  three consecutive requests after ~120 requests in ~25 minutes, which reads as throttling
  rather than a paging fault. The controller's ruling: **stop live LoC now.** The live
  enumeration becomes **controller step C0**, before C1: a >=24h cool-off (not before
  2026-09-28 ~23:00 CDT), `LOC_INTERVAL` **20 s** start-to-start (the already-committed
  default -- pages may slow to ~10 s under strain; watch for a full page slowing from ~3 s to
  >=8 s as an early warning), a session cap of 260 (the remaining budget under the 400 total),
  stop on a second `RemoteDisconnected`/refusal and escalate to Nick -- no further automatic
  retries, estimated 165-230 requests for a complete enumeration. Only 1 of the 24 LoC
  channels (`bath.isbn=97984009*`, 55 records) is complete in the cache today.

Controller steps still open: **C3** (first full build, needs C0 done first), **C4** (set the
exported floors + fill `docs/krcn-market.md`'s "First build" section, same commit), **C5**
(label `krcn-new-works.tsv` by eye, re-verify the linker fixture), **C6** (AniList for the new
EN lines -- automatic in 8a, no separate step needed beyond letting CI's build-only run make
the ~8-30 requests), **C7** (regenerate and upload the CI cache seed, dispatch `seed-cache`,
then a build-only CI run), **C8** (publish -- Nick's gate, only after a green build-only run
with `CARRY_SHA256` set and no degraded flag).

Gotchas:
- **C0 ruling 2026-09-29: an ISBN stem over the 500-position window is sliced before any page.**
  LoC blocks the workstation's IP since the 09-27 burst (a GitHub runner is served), so C0 runs on a
  runner. There, `97988554*` (564) was re-read at 100/50/25, and each read found records the others
  had missed (`LocIncomplete`, 51 requests). `loc_sru.WINDOW` = 500 now sends any stem whose count is
  over it straight to its ten prefixes (`9781975*` 1,551 and `97988554*` 562 today; every subject
  channel is under 500).
- **Option 1, one read (Nick 2026-09-29): a LoC set is read once and a gap is reported, not failed.**
  On the runner, even the slice `979885540*` (223, under the window) returned new records on every
  re-read ([0, 5, 1] at 100/50/25), so the 09-27 rule of confirming reads could never pass on the Yen
  stems, and re-reading costs ~7x the pages, past the 400-request budget. `_verified` now accepts the one
  read; `announced - distinct` goes to `loc-dups.json` / `loc-report.json` as `unconfirmed`. It is never
  `degraded` and never blocks. More distinct than announced is still `LocIncomplete`.
- **Until C0 is done, run this branch's `rebuild_all.sh` / `build_krcn.py` only with
  `LOC_OFFLINE=1`.** Without it, stage 3f pages LoC live and would re-enter the throttling the
  cool-off exists to avoid. Offline, an uncached LoC channel fails the stage loudly (R7) --
  that is the intended behaviour until C0 finishes.
- **3f cannot re-run after an adoption.** Adoption moves staging rows and remaps their volumes
  onto the surviving public id; a second `unload`/reload on the same catalogue after that point
  is not supported.
- **The new-work fixture must be labelled (plan C5) before the first publish.** 8c fails on an
  unlabelled `krcn-new-works.tsv` row by design (P19).
- **Regenerate the seed from the full `.cache`, and merge the manifests as JSON.** The LoC /
  BnF result sets and `.cache/loc-sets.json` / `.cache/bnf-sets.json` are in the local cache
  now. When building the seed side directory, merge each `.cache/<src>-sets.json` manifest as
  JSON (union the entries) rather than copying only the files the seed is missing --
  copy-only-missing drops set entries a CI run itself fetched that never got a corresponding
  new cache *file* the naive diff would notice.
- **A copied catalogue keeps its old `clean_claim` view.** `clean_claim` is a SQL view baked in
  at schema-creation time; a catalogue copied from before this round predates `us_gov_pd` and
  will silently exclude every LoC claim from the commercial subset; a fresh build recreates it
  from `schema/schema.sql`.
- **Ize ECIP records resolve their medium only through the review file or a later LoC
  upgrade.** A level-5 Ize record (no `041`/`082`/`050`/`655`) has no classification signal of
  its own; it either matches an existing DE/FR sibling's medium or goes to `krcn-review.tsv`.
- **BnF origin inheritance is child-first.** A child record's own `101 $c` always wins over its
  head's; it inherits the head's KR/CN origin only when it has *no* `101 $c` of its own (a
  non-KR/CN own origin, e.g. `jpn`/`fre` under a `kor` head, is `origin_out_of_scope`, never
  overridden). Measured exposure today: 0 of 3,438 cached BnF records hit the inheriting case
  with a non-empty non-KR/CN own origin.
- **A carried KR/CN line never demotes.** 8c's `run_krcn` fails on any `krcn_line` row with
  `carried=1`, `exported=0` and role `held` / `review` / `unlinked` (absorbed / merged rows stay
  7b's). The fix for a real one is a `link_work` correction. Step 5 of `decide` first resolves the
  line's published work through the carry's work `id_redirect` rows and the carry's adoptions.
- **An adopted work is re-adopted every build, never split.** A catalogue line (Wikipedia, 3e)
  whose published work is a library work id now sits under an internal Wikipedia work W: 3f
  renames W back to the public id (step 7), and every placement of that public id -- a
  `link_work`, a frozen cluster, a kept line -- goes to W first. `link_work` may name a
  Wikipedia work, a published library-born work, or an adopted public id -- never an id the carry
  redirected (stale; the log names the id to use); 8c's `run_link_work` reads the corrected work
  through `krcn:adopted` renames and counts `adopting` lines as shipped. A public id whose present
  lines now sit under SEVERAL works stops 3f (load's SystemExit names the works, lines and public
  id): decide with a `link_work` correction.
- **`loc:offline` / `bnf:offline` are NOT blocking.** When CI's probe finds a gateway
  unreachable, 3f records `{"reason": "unreachable", "stale_sets": N}` (N = result sets served
  past their refresh window) in catalogue meta and `krcn-report.json` and prints a NOTE; the
  export does not copy it and `publish.sh` does not refuse it (P13). Only `loc:degraded` /
  `bnf:degraded` (a refresh that failed mid-run) still block. `unload` clears both.
- **The CI cache is saved once the library sources are complete, even if a later gate fails.**
  `tier0/rebuild_all.sh` removes `build/sources-complete.marker` before 3e and writes it right after
  3f; `catalogue.yml` restores with `actions/cache/restore` and its last step
  (`actions/cache/save`, the same key `opentome-cache-<run id>-<attempt>`) runs when the run was not cancelled, the marker exists and the
  restore was not an exact hit. A failure after 3f keeps that run's LoC / BnF / DNB fetches; a
  failure or kill before the marker saves nothing (as before). Stage-4+ cache writes saved along
  with it: Open Library per-ISBN entries are tmp+rename; openBD / OL batch JSON (`verify._fetch`),
  BnF per-ISBN XML (`enrich_more._fetch_xml`) and AniList (`resolve_anilist._cache_put`) are single
  whole-file writes of an in-memory response, not tmp+rename (partial only on an OSError mid-write).
- **3e's DNB stop carries into 3f.** `build_krcn.run` seeds `dnb_sru.DEGRADED` from catalogue
  meta `dnb:degraded` (3e's value; read after `unload`), so 3f serves stale DNB sets from the
  cache instead of re-requesting DNB after 3e was throttled; the run is then DNB-degraded.
- **3e's linker index skips 3f's works** (meta `krcn:works_made`), so a `KEEP_DB=1` rerun of 3e
  after 3f reads the same index a fresh build's 3e reads. `same_ids` (8d) no longer rewrites
  `build/loc-report.json`, and a reserved (JP-round) id is never taken in step 2 either.
- **Only `taken_weak` and the demotion rule block publishing** among the KR/CN id checks; of
  `krcn-report.json`'s `gate` lists only `taken_weak` blocks (the others --
  `left`, `kept_no_overlap`, `absorbed_weak`, `p22_thin`, `work_redirects`, `adopt_conflicts`,
  `carried_not_exported`, `carried_work_changed`, `hangul_only_authors`, `authors_differ`,
  `deferred_to_jp_round`, `jp_guard_overrides` and `adoption_isbn_clash` -- are informational,
  per `build_krcn.gate_report`'s docstring). A `taken_weak` entry `[line key, carried id]` is
  confirmed as safe only through `export/fixtures/krcn_linker_labels.json`'s `taken_ok` list.
- **A refresh that re-clusters DE KR/CN lines counts toward `run_ids`'s retired-line cap of 10**
  (§13 "Watch"). The carry lookup before minting (§8) keeps a re-clustered line from being
  re-keyed if it was already published -- a trip against the cap is a real change worth looking
  at, not an artifact of the cap itself.
- **Step 5 of Task 14 (the offline pipeline-order dry run) must be re-run with the committed
  `run()` after C0 finishes.** Every dry run so far used an uncommitted driver
  (`build/krcn-replay/t14/dryrun.py`) that skips only the LoC channels the cache can't serve;
  it is not `tier0/rebuild_all.sh`'s real call path and was never intended to be committed. Any
  figure drawn from these dry runs is provisional until
  then (1 of 24 LoC channels cached; the LoC-side counts are a lower bound, not the real EN
  set).

Open for Nick (listed, not argued):
- **R4: whether non-DLC LoC records may be taken as bare facts** (ISBN, volume number, title,
  year) rather than excluded outright. Today: DLC-only. Cost of staying DLC-only: 73 English
  lines / 218 volumes excluded (WEBTOON Unscrolled incl. Tower of God and Noblesse, Inklore,
  Seven Seas).
- **P25, the set-level split.** 14 DNB parent sets have some volumes claimed by the JP round's
  `select` and others by the KR/CN round's; this round defers each whole set to the JP round
  rather than splitting it. A set-level split (each round keeps only the volumes it claims) is
  a possible follow-up.
- **Open (new, narrower than before): merging BnF heads across an imprint rename.** See
  "2026-09-28 follow-ups" below -- the publisher-family rule is done, but 4 of the 14 titles
  are split by two distinct BnF head records, which the family rule cannot merge. Joining
  those heads is a separate, head-identity change with public-id consequences and needs its
  own ruling.

**2026-09-28 follow-ups (post-code-complete; two dnb_sru commits + one bnf_unimarc commit):**
- **DNB transport gap, fixed.** `dnb_sru._live`'s retry tuple, and `get()`'s/`search()`'s outer
  degrade tuples, now catch `http.client.HTTPException` (`IncompleteRead` and friends, raised
  mid-read) and `socket.timeout` (`TimeoutError`'s alias only from Python 3.10) the same way
  they already catch `URLError`/`TimeoutError`/`ConnectionError`: an ERR netlog line, 3
  attempts 30 s apart, then (in `get()`/`search()`) degrade a refresh run onto its cached
  response/set instead of crashing. Checked `lib_sru.py` (LoC/BnF): its `fetch()` already
  catches `(URLError, OSError, http.client.HTTPException)`, which covers `socket.timeout` and
  `ConnectionError` via `OSError` -- confirmed, not re-fixed.
- **The BnF publisher renames (Tokebi/Saphira → Samji) -- the family rule is done.**
  `bnf_unimarc.pubfam` now folds Samji/Tokebi/Saphira to one family (P10 triggered). Measured
  against the cached BnF records: the fix only relabels `pubfam` on 73 lines published by one
  of the three names -- it changes no grouping, membership, volume list or review status for
  any of the 196 FR lines / 1,165 volumes (identical before/after, confirmed line by line and
  by re-running the pipeline-order dry run). Of the 14 named titles: 10 were already one line
  each (rejoined earlier by 461 $0 head identity, independent of this fix; 6 of those 10 --
  Veritas, Les ailes du phénix, Metal heart, Rure, Trois soeurs jumelles, Yongbi -- are in
  `duplicate_numbers` review, pre-existing, not caused by this fix); the other 4 -- Yureka,
  Demon king, Platina, Unbalance X2 -- are still two lines each. Each of those 4 has its
  pre-rename and post-rename volumes under two (or three) DISTINCT BnF head records (461 $0 set
  records); `bnf_lines` groups head-numbered volumes strictly by head id, never by publisher
  family, so unifying the family cannot merge them. **Yureka's Samji reissue does NOT land in
  `duplicate_numbers` review**, contrary to the original prediction, which assumed a headless
  (no-461-$0) matching mechanism these 4 titles don't actually use.

**2026-09-28 export fixes E1-E4 (from the Mangarr consumer scoping, `krcn-consumer-findings.md`;
report `.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-27-krcn-coverage/export-fixes-report.md`):**
- **E1, Solo Leveling. New library lines never take precedence over carried lines.** Two layers:
  - 3f `decide`: a NEW library line (not carried) that is linked by title (not a `link_work`
    correction) or is an ISBN `sibling`, has no vol 1, and sits in a work + market that already
    has a carried line of the same novel/comic class goes to **review, reason `fragment`** (joined
    onto any earlier reason). The dry run's two: FR Kbooks
    `bnf:ark:/12148/cb46910428j` (vols 4/15/17) and DE `dnb:1281034274` (8/11/15; the existing
    rules cannot merge it -- `attach_roles` merges one line per target and `dnb:1216062943` holds
    that merge). `read_carry` now records each carried line's market (`K["line_market"]`).
  - `to_mangarr`: a new library-born line (in `krcn:ids`, absent from the carry) sorts after every
    carried line of its (work, market, medium) group for `is_main`, is never the named line a
    carried group's unnamed lines hang under, and keeps an `orig_series_id` only when a carried
    line of its work, market and novel/comic class shares it (Mangarr's `PickSibling` ranks a
    counterpart first). Without a carry (cold export) nothing changes.
- **E2.** `loc_marc.native_titles` strips a trailing ". English|Korean|Chinese|Japanese|French|
  German" (a 240 `$l` a vernacular 880 folds into its `$a`) -- only after ". " and only when
  Hangul / Hanzi / kana precede it ("Mr. English" stays); the alias `english` is gone.
- **E3.** `to_mangarr`'s origin lookup treats manga / manhwa / manhua as one comic family, used
  only when a line's own medium has no origin line (a same-medium origin always wins): King of
  Hell DE, Unbalance X2 FR, Biao Ren DE gain an origin; one carried line changes (ORV
  "(Physical publication)" EN: NULL -> the ko line, status NULL -> ongoing), listed in
  `ORIG_CHANGE_OK`. `run()`'s "orig_series_id ... origin-market mismatch" rule
  (`orig_mismatches`) accepts a comic-family medium pair only when the origin market has no line
  of the licensed line's own medium (never a novel).
- **E4.** A library-born FR line whose work has no official fr title takes its `bnf` line_name as
  `local_name` (5 lines).
- **New BLOCKING rules in `run_krcn`:** with a carry -- no carried line loses `is_main`,
  `local_name` or alias rows, or is parented under a line absent from the carry (allowed: a
  carried id redirect -- the old parent redirected to the new one, or a carried line of the same
  (work, market, medium) retired into that group's current main line -- and `ALIAS_LOSS_OK`, today the 3 Kindaichi lines' broken
  "s Enquêtes" aliases, base drift); carried `orig_series_id` changes only in `ORIG_CHANGE_OK` (keyed line, old orig, new orig);
  always -- no alias, series name, local_name or catalogue work title that is only a language name
  (en/fr/de forms, raw or normalized). Gotcha: the carried-line rule has no churn allowance -- a
  Wikipedia refresh that legitimately renames or re-mains a carried line fails it until the row is
  listed or explained.
- **Measure floor:** the offline dry run's DE exported volumes drop 273 -> 270 (the DE fragment's
  3 volumes), under the provisional floor 273 (`KRCN_EXPORTED_FLOORS`, set for real at C4).

## 2026-09-28 — Moved to the `opentomedb` GitHub org

`opentome`, `mangarr-metadata` (the catalogue releases) and `opentome-cache` moved from DrAwesome441 to the
**`opentomedb`** org (Nick's decision; Mangarr's repos moved too). Old URLs redirect, release-asset downloads included.
Every repo reference, the site links and the source user agents now say `opentomedb`. **Tokens:** the two
Actions secrets `MANGARR_METADATA_TOKEN` (write, mangarr-metadata) and `OPENTOME_CACHE_TOKEN` (read, opentome-cache)
were personal-account fine-grained PATs and could not reach the org's repos after the move (checked with a
throwaway workflow: 404); they are replaced by org-owned fine-grained tokens (resource owner `opentomedb`).
Publish command is now `gh workflow run catalogue.yml -R opentomedb/opentome --ref main -f publish=true`.
The site serves `catalogue/version.json` (a copy of the release manifest) for Mangarr's stable-URL fetch.

## 2026-09-25 — branch `alias-fix`: work_title des/du, a general carried-id redirect writer

Not merged, not pushed, not published -- Nick's gate (CI build-only first; publish = standing OK
after a green build-only run).

Done (one commit per step; design + numbers: `docs/carried-ids.md`):
- `tier0/carried_ids.py redirect` (stage **7b**, after the audit, before the export): every work,
  line and volume id of the carried artifact the build lost -> `id_redirect`, any market, any
  cause (ISBN majority, else dated volumes, volumes by number; `retired` to the line / main line
  when nothing else holds). Excluded works retire without a row; anything else is an orphan.
  The export now counts work ids as present, so a `work` redirect reaches the artifact.
- `tier0/carried_ids.py merge` (stage **4c**, after the enrichment): a work the carry published
  that is now part of another brings re-keyed lines; one that repeats a PUBLISHED line of the
  survivor (same market + medium, most ISBNs) merges into it -- the published line untouched, its
  name partners pinned to it (`origin_line`, source `opentome`). Scoped to absorbing works and
  unpublished lines: the 496 published same-edition pairs in today's catalogue are not touched.
- `export/test_artifact.py run_ids`: every market, works included, plus every id the carry's own
  `id_redirect` already resolved; excluded works exempt; DE cap (25) unchanged; new cap: > 100
  carried volumes RETIRED (not resolving to a volume) fails (fix round 1: also lines > 10, moved > 500).
- `work_title()`: des/du restore Les/Le; the article fragment is shared with `local_title`.
- Measured offline against the published `opentome-2026-09-25` (downloaded once, as CI's "restore
  id carry" does; zero other network): 4 of 9,668 names change; 13 lines / 247 volumes / 1 work
  leave the artifact, all 261 redirected (line correction 10, line duplicate_merge 3, volume
  correction 175, volume duplicate_merge 72, work duplicate_merge 1), 0 retired, 0 orphans.
  Series 13,035 -> 13,032, volumes 123,930 -> 123,858, aliases 90,380 -> 90,379. Every id in both
  builds: identical columns; only other change: 3 Kindaichi Case Files lines' alias "s Enquêtes de
  Kindaichi" -> "Les Enquêtes de Kindaichi". Contract: only the two AniList rules (8a not run);
  measure 49/49, 0 coverage failures, DE floors unchanged. Second build on the new artifact: 0 new
  / 0 changed, and the gate re-checks the 261 redirected ids (0 lost); `volumes_special` identical;
  the unfixed corpus through the new stages: identical to main.

**Fix round 1 (same day, after review "not safe to publish"):**
- C1: no carry in CI (`OPENTOME_CI=1` / `CI=true`) fails the restore step, `rebuild_all.sh` and
  4c/7b, unless `OPENTOME_COLD_START=1` (catalogue.yml input `cold_start`); `meta.carried_from`;
  publish.sh refuses an artifact without it (unless cold start); the gate checks carried integers.
- C2: a retired line's volumes never match by number (unique ISBN in the market, else `retired` to
  the line); caps: retired lines > 10, retired volumes > 100, ids moved THIS build > 500.
- I1: chains stop at the first present id; a carried row whose old id is live again is dropped
  (reported by 7b, skipped by the export) -- a reverted re-key makes no cycle.
- I2: majority ties are ambiguous (reported, an orphan, the gate fails), never broken by hash
  order. I4: 4c merges only a line matching one of the ABSORBED work's published lines; merges are
  recorded in `meta.merged_lines` so later builds repeat them. I3: docs/mangarr-migration.md
  documents line / volume / work rows and `old_series_id` lookup.
- Minors: derived origin pins warn instead of raising; 7b's presence = the export's (volumes_special
  not present); volumes match a unique ISBN in the successor line first; stage 0 prints a failing
  suite's output.
- Also: a gate that a duplicate recorded in the carry's `meta.merged_lines` never ships again, and
  `docs/id-scheme.md` names the one exception to "nothing is removed from id_redirect" (a row whose
  old id is live again).
- New caps (retired lines > 10, volumes > 100, moved > 500) are unmeasured against a DNB refresh:
  DE lines 3e retires count toward the line cap -- watch the first scheduled CI build; raise the
  threshold if it trips spuriously.
- Re-measured offline (same setup, 0 new cache files): the same 261 redirects byte for byte, same
  integers, gate green apart from the two AniList rules, measure 49/49 (log identical to main's),
  second build a no-op (moved 0); OPENTOME_CI=1 without a carry fails, with cold start it builds.

**Fix round 2 (same day, re-review "safe to publish" with three fixes):**
- N1: a tie goes to the single candidate NEW in this build (a re-key beside its published
  same-edition twin -- 456 of the 496 pairs nest); any other tie is still ambiguous.
- N2: 3e (build_dnb.redirects) uses 7b's volume rule (`carried_ids.volume_successor`): a retired
  German line's volumes never match the main line's books by number.
- N3: publish.sh refuses a `cold-start` artifact without `OPENTOME_COLD_START=1` at publish time,
  and a carried one unless `CARRY_SHA256` (CI: `build/carry.sha256` from the restore step; by
  hand: the live version.json's sha256) equals `meta.carried_sha256`. ROLLBACK_TO past this
  release un-publishes its redirects -- Nick's go-ahead.
- Re-verified: 7b re-run on the measured catalogue + export: the same 261 redirects and integers,
  gate green (AniList rules aside), measure 49/49; no full rebuild (3e wrote 0 redirects here).

Next:
- **Publishing from a workstation now needs `CARRY_SHA256`** (the live version.json's sha256).
- Merge, CI build-only, then publish. Mangarr reads `id_redirect` for `release_line` rows; the
  `work` and `volume` rows are additive; integers resolve through `old_series_id` (the coordinator
  sends Mangarr the matching follow-up).
- Open, deliberately left: the 496 published same-work same-edition line pairs (merging them
  retires consumer-held ids -- a separate decision), and the openBD batch-cache hazard (Gotchas).
- Nick: the French Gouttes de Dieu lines are now named "Drops of God (Les Gouttes de Dieu)" /
  "... - Mariage" (the work's title is English now; `local_name` stays "Les Gouttes de Dieu").
  The French article's JP data for the merged volumes is dropped; Drops of God JP vol 25 keeps
  the English article's ISBN 9784063728491 (vol 23's) where the French article had
  9784063729153 -- a `corrections/volumes.json` candidate.

Gotchas:
- **Stage 0 now gates the build** (f182bbb): before it, `python3 t.py >/dev/null && echo ok` under
  `set -e` only skipped the echo when a suite failed (bash exempts non-final `&&` members), so a red
  suite never stopped a build. Now a failing suite prints its whole output and exits 1 (f520796).
  This makes the `narrow-fold` "BLOCKER for CI" below real: until that branch's fixture term is
  recorded, its failing `test_resolve_anilist.py` stops the build at stage 0.
- openBD is cached by whole 80-ISBN batches of the sorted JP ISBNs: anything that changes the JP
  ISBN set before stage 4 re-keys every later batch (the merge moved from 3a to 4c for that).
  Offline, a missed batch drops dates silently (`_fetch` returns an error dict); locally 217 of
  755 batch URLs are uncached already.
- A merge pins by exact line name (a derived `origin_line`, source `opentome`); if it disagrees
  with the picked origin market the export warns and falls back (a correction's pin still raises).


## preferred-edition-v0 (2026-09-24, NOT published)

Mangarr's Preferred Edition (spec: mangarr docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-preferred-edition-design.md §6 a–d + plan A6)
needs four additive artifact reads: `series.local_name`, `series.country` (market code verbatim), `series_alias.language/kind`,
meta `markets`, plus `id_redirect` (entity `release_line`) for retired line ids. Tests: test_to_mangarr.py (local_title cases from the measured
FR/DE/JP data), contract rules in test_artifact.py. Alias ORDER unchanged (diffed against the pre-change export). Next:
review, merge, build-only CI green, then publish (standing OK) — Mangarr v1 reads these behind guards and works without them.

The `work_title()` "de eats des" item deferred here is done on branch `alias-fix` (below).

## 2026-09-24 — branch `dnb-ingest`: the German market from DNB (stage 3e)

**Review round (same day):** the independent review's ten items are fixed, one commit each
(NFC; linker precision + `must_not_link` fixture; bundles / boxes + protected-line gate; id
contract: exported `id_redirect`, `kept`, carried-id gate, integer rule; clustering: publisher
families + signature merge; volume numbers; CI: `DNB_REFRESH_DAYS=6`, refresh fallback, stable
parent batches; date floor on deposited volumes; origin regex; Magmell / leading "The").
Re-measured offline, zero DNB requests: **DE 1,459 lines / 12,470 volumes**, linked 1,229 high
+ 194 medium, merged 31, sibling 1; review 207; ground truth 31/33, 0 wrong; labelled 44/45;
dates 99.8% of deposited; split editions 13 works / 26 lines (was 49 / 111). Numbers below are
the first build's.

Not merged, not pushed, no CI triggered -- Nick's gate.

Done (design: `docs/dnb-design.md`, results: `docs/german-market.md`):
- `tier0/dnb_sru.py` (>= 3 s cross-process throttle, one Retry-After wait then stop, cache,
  `build/dnb-netlog.tsv`, `DNB_OFFLINE`, opt-in `DNB_REFRESH_DAYS`), `tier0/dnb_enumerate.py`
  (spo=jpn print + manga imprints + parents; jhr slices + a `not jhr>0` remainder; distinct
  totals checked), `tier0/dnb_marc.py`, `tier0/dnb_link.py`, `tier0/build_dnb.py` (stage 3e,
  after relations), tests `tier0/test_dnb.py` (stage 0).
- Export: `volumes.release_date_type` (additive), DNB in `meta.attribution` + LICENSE-DATA.md,
  `meta.dnb_lines`, redirected lines keep their integer id. `tier2/resolve.py`: a bare DNB
  year never beats a finer date it disagrees with (9 volumes; 0 resolution changes elsewhere).
- CI uploads `build/dnb-review.tsv`, `dnb-report.json`, `dnb-netlog.tsv` with the build.
- Gates: DNB rules in `export/test_artifact.py` (needs the catalogue as 2nd arg -- the
  rebuild passes it) incl. the linker fixture `export/fixtures/dnb_linker_labels.json` and
  the 35 pre-DNB ids `export/fixtures/de_lines_pre_dnb.json`; German floors in
  `export/measure_library.py` (`--catalogue=`), printed after the `matched` line.
- Stage 8a ran locally through a driver in `build/` (not committed) that leaves uncached
  AniList terms unbound; the rebuild's final `mv` never ran, so `build/manga-metadata.sqlite`
  is still the 2026-09-20 artifact and the DNB build is `build/manga-metadata.sqlite.new`.
- Measured (offline rebuild, warm cache): DE 35 lines / 391 vols -> **1,593 / 12,678**
  (1,557 linked + 30 merged + 1 sibling + the 5 unmerged Wikipedia lines); linker
  high 1,246 / medium 353 / low 210 / ambiguous 7 / none 2,740; ground truth 30/32 linked,
  0 wrong; labelled set 43/44 (97.7%); dates 95.8%, pages 97.8%; review file 217 lines.
  392 live DNB requests in all, all 200. Non-German side byte-identical to a DNB-free
  export; replay `--base main` 0 new / 0 changed / 0 lost.

Next:
- **Seed the CI cache before the next CI build -- and regenerate the seed, never append.**
  CI's cache has no DNB responses. Unseeded, the first CI build has no complete earlier result
  sets, so any DNB failure fails it (DnbIncomplete), and `actions/cache` saves only on success.
  The only procedure: rebuild the tarball from the FULL current local `.cache`, which now holds
  the DNB responses AND `.cache/dnb-parents.json` (the parent-batch index):
  `tar --zstd -cf opentome-cache.tar.zst -C .cache .`, upload it as the private
  opentome-cache repo's `seed` release asset, run the seed-cache workflow. Never append files
  to the old tarball and never build it from a subset -- a partial seed silently lacks
  whatever it misses, and the next cold CI run re-fetches it (or, for AniList, binds
  differently).
- Refreshing: `DNB_REFRESH_DAYS=6` is now set in `catalogue.yml` (last year, this year and
  later, the no-year remainder, when older than 6 days: ~62 requests a week, plus up to 42
  small recounts when a total moved). Parents are fetched once (stable batches via
  `.cache/dnb-parents.json`), never refreshed. A result set is cached whole or not at all. When
  DNB fails during a refresh, a result set with a previous COMPLETE page set keeps that set
  (never a partial or empty one), the build continues, and it is marked degraded
  (`meta.dnb_degraded`): `export/publish.sh` refuses to publish it. A result set with NO complete
  earlier set -- a first run, an unseeded cache, a new slice -- fails the build loudly, refresh
  window or not (CI always sets one). The contract also fails when more than 25 carried German
  volumes are retired in one build.
- Nick: `build/dnb-review.tsv` (207 low/ambiguous lines) -- confirmed ones could become
  corrections; the design has no correction type for "link this DNB line" yet.
- Follow-ups: KR/CN round (decision 4); light novels are thin (19 lines) -- LN works are
  linked less often; the 518 current-year announcements without a 263 month are undated.

Gotchas:
- The date floor is now on deposited volumes (99.8%); announced-only volumes are reported
  apart and cannot trip it.
- `dnb_member.volume_id` can point at a volume a later stage deleted (5b exclusions).
- The spike's `From the sea` (Okubo one-shot in the Fire Force series statement) still links
  to Fire Force; spin-offs named inside a parent's series statement link to the parent.
- 13 works still split across lines by a subtitle variant between set records ("Kemono jihen"
  / "Kemono Jihen. Gefährlichen Phänomenen auf der Spur"); a post-link merge would fix it.
- `id_map` now keeps `retired` rows for carried line ids a build no longer has: 55 today, all
  outside the German market (en 27, ja 25, fr 3) -- the lines of works excluded since the
  20 September artifact (W.I.T.C.H., Mechademia, The Walking Dead, The Adventures of Rabbi
  Harvey, ...). A correct catalogue-wide fix: each reserves its integer so it is never reissued.
  They have NO `id_redirect` row, deliberately: an excluded work has no successor line to point
  at (none shares work + language + name). Nothing but the exporter reads `id_map`. Say this in
  the merge commit message. The carried-id gate has only met the 35 German Wikipedia lines so
  far; the DNB-line redirect path is unit-tested and meets real data at the second publish.
- `DNB_REFRESH_DAYS` is 6 on the rebuild step (87c7f0f replaced the step's 7 per the review:
  a 7-day window on a 7-day cron skips alternate weeks). Revert 87c7f0f for 7.
- 879 German volumes ship undated (announced, no planned month, or a plan older than 12 months);
  a consumer that treats undated as "missing" will search for them.
- DE lines of Swiss publishers carry 978-2 ISBNs (Kazé / Crunchyroll SA): the audit's
  "DE lines with no DE-group ISBN" info line counts them; 14 volumes collide with FR lines
  citing the same ISBN (flagged, info).

## 2026-09-24 — branch `anilist-round2`: post-walk tiers, R6+, 26 pins, 4 exclusions

Not merged, not pushed, no CI triggered -- Nick's gate (CI build-only; bar 0 changed / 0 lost).

Done (one commit each, each droppable):
- `export/resolve_anilist.py` post-walk tiers (`post_walk()`, spec in the module docstring): V1
  prefix / V2 arc / V3 amp / V4 origin, only for lines still unbound after the whole walk, over
  pages the walk already fetched (zero new queries). `load_line()` carries `orig_vc`. Offline
  replay `--base main` on opentome-2026-09-24: 52 new (26 / 19 / 5 / 2), 0 changed, 0 lost. V3 is
  primary-title only (its one synonym match was the doubtful Shino & Ren -> "...: Future").
- R6+ (own commit): wider edition allowlist, unclosed trailing parenthetical, bare "volumes"
  heading; the nested-series guard also catches "series(" now. +3 over the post-walk commit, 0 / 0;
  19 new stripped terms uncached (live-only).
- `corrections/anilist.json`: 26 pins (18 high + 8 medium from the analysis), each re-verified on
  the cached page. Nausicaä (Perfect Collection) -> 30651 not pinned: the id is on no cached page.
- `corrections/excluded.json`: W.I.T.C.H. (takes the wrong 41582 bind with it), IDW My Little
  Pony, Mechademia, Fair, then Partly Piggy.

Next:
- CI build-only; watch the 19 uncached R6+ terms and the live-only post-walk pages. Live CHANGED
  watch list (bound today through an alias; R6+ now searches an uncached stripped name first):
  `Days volume list` (86600 via "DAYS" -> "Days", the likeliest to flip), `Golgo 13 (Viz Media
  English volumes)` (31298 via "Duke Togo" -> "Golgo 13"), `The World of Narue (Manga volumes)`
  (34844 via "Narue no Sekai" -> "The World of Narue"). Post-walk binds report as prefix / arc /
  amp / origin in `anilist-resolve-report.tsv`; R6+ binds report as `alias`.
- Nick: Rick and Morty (w_80704d7f33e4) is NOT excluded -- the work also carries the OEL
  "Rick and Morty: The Manga" line and an exclusion takes every line of the work.
- Nick: the four `[]` The Beginning After the End pages in `.cache/anilist/` (manga + novel, name
  + deslug, all written 2026-09-15) look like a bad fetch; purge + refetch is his call.

Gotchas:
- V1's only guard against a 3+-volume line binding a differently-titled sequel entry (Shino & Ren
  -> "Shino & Ren: Future" shape) is uniqueness + the >= 3 gate; the Shino line is 1 volume.
- `export/test_artifact.py` against the CI artifact fails until a rebuild applies the new pins and
  exclusions (checked on a patched copy: contract ok).

## 2026-09-24 — branch `narrow-fold`: Latin-only accent strip + numeric-symbol fold + alias seen seed

Not merged, not pushed, no CI triggered -- Nick's gate (CI build-only, live diff vs the published
report; ship bar 0 lost / 0 changed).

Done (three commits, each droppable -- `git revert` of the seed or of the numeric fold applies
cleanly on top; reverting the Latin strip alone needs a one-hunk hand merge in fold()):
- `fold()` in `export/resolve_anilist.py`, shared by `key()` and `for_search()`:
  `strip_latin_marks()` (NFD, a combining mark dropped only after a Latin-script letter, NFC;
  unchanged strings come back byte for byte -- kana voicing, Hangul, Cyrillic, CJK untouched,
  checked over 59,110 catalogue + cached AniList strings) and `fold_numeric()` (No / Nl ->
  NFKC per character, U+2044 -> "/": "Ranma ½" is searched as "Ranma 1/2", AniList's own romaji;
  key() still gives ranma12).
- `alias_terms()` seeds `seen` with key(name), key(deslug(name)) and key(ascii_normalize(name))
  (a mirror of to_mangarr.normalize, asserted equal in the tests).
- Offline replay vs 2146f47 on the ci-mf build (3,054 EN lines): 1 new (Café Terrace), 0 changed,
  7 lost -- every one through a changed, uncached search term (MÄR, Übel Blatt, Ōoku, Saintia Shō,
  BakéGyamon, both Ranma ½ edition lines). A proxied replay (a folded term borrows the accented
  term's cached page) keeps 6 on the same id; BakéGyamon binds by name on the cached
  case-variant "Bakegyamon" page. No loss comes from key()/pick() ranking a page differently.
  The seed alone: 0 / 0 / 0, +26 uncached alias terms.

Next:
- BLOCKER for CI: `tier0/rebuild_all.sh` step 0 runs `export/test_resolve_anilist.py`, and with
  the Latin strip that suite fails on the unrecorded fixture term (Gotchas). (Written when stage 0
  did not actually gate -- a failing suite under `&&` never tripped `set -e`; since f182bbb on
  `alias-fix` it does, so this blocks.)
  Either record that one page (`ANILIST_RECORD=1 python3 export/test_resolve_anilist.py` fetches
  only the missing term) or drop the Latin strip; the seed alone, and numeric + seed, run green.
- Then CI build-only; the numbers above are all live-only. If a part loses binds live, revert it.
- Live CHANGED watch list: 24 lines (22 names) keep their id offline but now cross an uncached
  folded alias term BEFORE the alias that binds them (Arifureta, Hell Mode x2, Bumpkin x2, Trinity
  Seven, Rascal, Papillon, ...); plus the 12 published edition lines (Tankōbon / Shinsōban /
  Aizōban) whose name and deslug terms change. The seed alone and numeric + seed: none.
- Mangarr: mirror fold() in TitleMatcher.Normalize / TitleNormalizer.ForSearch (separate task).
  Latin = `c.isalpha()` and "LATIN" in the character's Unicode name (C# needs an explicit table).

Gotchas:
- `export/test_resolve_anilist.py` aborts offline: the Harsh Mistress fixture's alias
  "...Kakuzetsu Toshi no Joō" is now searched as "...Joo", which is not recorded (nor in
  `.cache/anilist/`). Needs `ANILIST_RECORD=1` (a live request) -- the maintainer's call. With that
  page proxied locally the suite is 181/181, the 44 audited lines unmoved.
- "Ranma 1/2" (the search term since 0e2e3e4, AniList's romaji) is uncached locally; the proxied
  replay borrows the "Ranma ½" page for it, so the two Ranma lines are CI's call.

## 2026-09-24 — branch `display-fallback`: display-only AniList fallback + two stray exclusions

Not merged, not pushed, no CI triggered -- Nick's gate.

Done:
- `series.display_anilist_id` / `display_anilist_via` (`parent` | `medium`): a cover / synopsis
  id for an EN line the resolver leaves NULL -- never a binding (never copied into `anilist_id`,
  never an alias source, not read by Mangarr). `export/resolve_anilist.py --display`, stage 8a's
  third call (resolve, pins, display, covers-only); `anilist-covers.json` now covers display ids.
  Spec in `display()`'s docstring and `docs/schema-v1.md`; contract in `export/test_artifact.py`.
  Measured offline on a fresh export: 68 via parent (9 more skipped as ambiguous), 15 via medium.
- `corrections/excluded.json`: Sweet Tooth (Vertigo) and The Adventures of Rabbi Harvey -- the
  only two Western comics among the 31 unresolved EN lines with no origin line; the OEL /
  German / French manga and webtoons in that set stay (Nick's ruling).
- Offline replay vs 6a7c0f3: 0 new / 0 changed / 0 lost binds. Piecewise offline stages 5b
  (new exclusions only) - 8d: audit 0 defects, contract ok, measure 49/49.

Next:
- CI build-only run: the `medium` tier searches the manga-family page for each unbound novel
  name; 49 of those pages are uncached locally, so the live count may exceed 15.
- The homelab browser (not in this repo) reads `anilist-covers.json` by id; it shows display
  covers only if it also looks up `display_anilist_id`.
- Data follow-ups seen, not fixed: Gothic Sports is medium `novel` (a comic); the Monogatari EN
  lines are `novel` while the JA line is `light_novel`, which is likely why they have no
  `orig_series_id` and stay unbound.

Gotchas:
- Stage 8a is now FOUR calls. `--display` recomputes from scratch, so it must run after the pins.
- `parent` is same-work, any medium: an arc can take a different-medium parent's cover (the
  `Re:Zero (Truth of Zero)` manga shows the Re:Zero light novel's), and some arcs have their own
  AniList entry that the rules cannot reach (Truth of Zero is 87259). Display only, by design.

## 2026-09-24 — branch `anilist-resolve`: AniList resolver accuracy round

Not merged, not pushed, no CI triggered -- Nick's gate. Everything measured OFFLINE against
`.cache/anilist/` with the new `export/replay_anilist.py` (stock `ca0935f` vs working tree over
all 3,056 EN lines of the `opentome-2026-09-24` release artifact, anilist_id reset, curated alias
removals applied; a cache miss = no result, counted as uncached).

Done:
- `corrections/anilist.json` -- new correction type, a hand-checked AniList id per line
  (`line` = `series.tome_id`). Applied by `tier2/corrections.py --anilist` right after
  `resolve_anilist.py` in stage 8a; validated by `--check`; asserted by `test_artifact.py`.
  Seed: Worst (EN, 3 vols) -> 31741.
- `corrections/aliases.json`: "Ginga Densetsu Riki" and "Ginga Legend Riki" removed from Weed.
- `pick()` tiers (docstring = spec): R4 ceiling fallback (Weed -> 34010, +10 short English
  runs; stands down beside any equal title that passes the ceiling), R5 substring + exact volumes (own name only; +14, Der Werwolf 98367 -> 114483 -- 10 of
  the analysis's 14; the missing 4 (Haruhi-chan, Re:Zero Truth of Zero / Frozen Bond,
  Restaurant First series) only match through alias terms and are left out by design; the
  other 4 are one-to-two-volume lines outside the analysis's scope: Bookworm Royal Academy
  Stories, Fairy Tail: Ice Trail, Slime (Again!) Workaholic, The Obsessed Mage),
  R6 edition-qualifier paren-strip retry (ranked like an alias; +9), R7 leading-article
  equality (+1, Hollow Regalia). Net: 35 new binds, 1 changed (Der Werwolf), 0 lost; vs the
  published artifact also Weed 38901 -> 34010; EN >= 3 vols unresolved 307 -> 280.
- Diacritic fold (fix #5) and alias-prefix-first order (fix #4): committed and REVERTED under
  the round's zero-change rule. The replay lost 8 and 5 currently-bound lines through changed
  or no-longer-searched terms -- all uncached, so unmeasured; a live A/B could reverse this.

Next:
- CI build-only run for the live numbers: 30 R6 stripped terms are uncached locally (upper
  bound), and the via tally now also prints article / substring / ceiling.
- Mangarr's AniListRanker has none of R4-R7; parity is its own decision.

Gotchas:
- `bash tier0/rebuild_all.sh` cannot run locally: without `ANILIST_OFFLINE=1` step 8a makes
  live requests; with it, 8a aborts on `OfflineMiss` (Roxy Gets Serious + two Hoshin Engi
  terms were already uncached). Stages 8-8d were verified piecewise offline (the round's
  report, delivered to the maintainer; replay outputs in the private sdd notes).
- Stage 8a is three calls (four since `display-fallback`): resolve, `corrections.py --anilist` (pins), then
  `resolve_anilist.py --covers-only`, so pinned ids get their fallback cover too.
- A diacritic fold in `for_search()` rewrites live search strings: NFKD drops kana voicing
  marks and turns ½ into 1⁄2 -- the narrow retry is branch `narrow-fold` (Latin-only strip),
  judged by a live A/B.

## 2026-09-24 — branch `roxy-en`: the English Roxy Gets Serious line, and an `origin_line` correction

Closes the one library measure-gate miss HANDOFF.md has been carrying since 2026-09-04
(v2.1/v2.2: *Mushoku Tensei: Roxy Gets Serious* has no English line because the English
Wikipedia article has no section for it). Not merged from here -- Nick's gate.

`corrections/lines.json` gains the English Seven Seas edition (12 volumes, EN manga,
`w_179929c7bc15`), read off the publisher's series page by the maintainer on 2026-09-24
with every ISBN-13 check digit validated. Adding it exposed a real defect, not just a
missing row: Mushoku Tensei's JP manga has TWO lines under the same (work, medium) --
the main serial and this Roxy spin-off -- and the JP Roxy line's own `line_name` claim
is not Japanese at all, it's the French string cross-parsed from the FR Wikipedia table
("Mushoku Tensei : Les Aventures de Roxy", the same string the FR Roxy line carries,
which is why FR pairs with JP correctly today). `export/to_mangarr.py`'s `origin_line()`
pairs a licensed line to its origin-market counterpart by an EXACT name-string match,
so the new EN line (named "Mushoku Tensei: Roxy Gets Serious", per Nick's instruction --
no reason to invent a mismatched key) cannot match it, and without a fix silently falls
back to the JP work's MAIN manga line: the new line would have read 12 of 25 volumes
against a still-running series and exported `stalled` instead of `completed`.

Fix, not a workaround: `corrections/lines.json` whole-edition entries gain an optional
`origin_line` key naming the exact origin-market line id. `tier2/corrections.py` validates
it (same work, same medium, market in `JP KR CN TW`, existence -- refusing a stale/wrong
target the same way the medium/market override shapes already do) and uses it for BOTH
`composition.ref_line_id` (in place of the same naive "any origin-market line for this
work+medium" query, which has the identical multi-line ambiguity) and a new `release_line`
claim (`field='origin_line'`) that `export/to_mangarr.py`'s `origin_line()` now checks
before falling back to the name-key match / main-line default. See `corrections/README.md`
for the full writeup. TDD: `tier0/test_parser.py` (apply + all four validation failures),
`tier2/test_corrections_check.py` (5 new cases against the published-artifact shape),
`export/test_to_mangarr.py` (an end-to-end fixture: two same-work JP lines, one pinned EN
line resolving to the spin-off, one unpinned EN line reproducing the defect against the
main line -- proves the fix without disturbing the unpinned default).

Verified OFFLINE, zero network (`find .cache -type f -newer <marker>` empty): a full
`ANILIST_OFFLINE=1 bash tier0/rebuild_all.sh` run against the warm cache. Stage 5b: "line
corrections applied 3 (39 volumes)" (the two pre-existing entries plus this one's 12).
Stage 7 audit: 0 outstanding defects. Stage 8a aborted as expected on `OfflineMiss` for
three uncached AniList search terms -- 'Mushoku Tensei: Roxy Gets Serious' (new, expected)
plus two unrelated pre-existing gaps ('Hoshin Engi' arc terms, nothing to do with this
change). Stage 8c (`export/test_artifact.py`) against the resulting `manga-metadata.sqlite.new`:
every rule passes except "EN lines without anilist_id" (2,523/2,523 unresolved -- expected,
since 8a never ran and wrote no ids at all, not specific to Roxy). Stage 8d (measure gate):
**49/49 matched, 0 coverage failures** (was 48/49; diffed against the pre-round `measure.log`,
only the Roxy row changed). Direct query: the new line's `orig_series_id` resolves to
`rl_e5f7e5f4fab0` (gcd_series_id 64852282, the JP Roxy line) -- not `rl_51690cde3090` (the
JP main manga line, gcd_series_id 2142409694) -- and its status exports `completed`, not
`stalled`. `tier2/corrections.py --check` against the new artifact: ok, 3 line / 3 medium /
1 market / 27 alias / 1 excluded entries resolve.

Next: a maintainer merges `roxy-en`, and the next `publish=true` dispatch (which also runs
a real, online `resolve_anilist.py`) ships both this line and its AniList id together.

## 2026-09-23 — cleanup-0923: exclude Walking Dead, curated alias removals, Denma market fix

Three corrections, TDD'd on branch `cleanup-0923` (not merged/published from here --
Nick's gate): (1) `corrections/excluded.json` (new file, new shape) removes The Walking
Dead (comic book) entirely -- a US comic that entered via a Wikipedia list-of-volumes
page; Arrietty (Comics), a legitimate Japanese Ghibli film comic that came in the same
way, stays. (2) `corrections/aliases.json` gains a `"remove": true` curated-removal form
and ~26 exact (line, alias) entries -- the "Good" set from the followups-0923
alias-hygiene review, re-verified against a fresh rebuild; NOT a re-introduction of the
reverted automated rule. (3) `corrections/lines.json` gains a market override (a third
narrow entry shape) retagging Denma's mislabelled "ja" line to KR -- it's the Naver
webtoon's own episode-arc list, not a Japanese print edition; see the 2026-09-23
"follow-up" entry below for the defect this fixes. Full details, measured numbers and
per-string reasoning are in the branch's two commits and `corrections/README.md`.

Deferred (Nick's call, not done): an automated Western-comics check at ingest time
(flag any incoming Wikipedia list-of-volumes page whose work isn't manga/light-novel/
manhwa/manhua before it ever reaches the catalogue). Walking Dead is one stray in
13,001 series -- not enough signal yet to justify a general rule; excluded.json handles
it and anything like it case by case for now.

## 2026-09-23 — follow-up: Denma's "ja" line is really the Naver webtoon

Logged during the `followups-0923` branch review (item 4, the Denma `orig_series_id`
fix — a `corrections/lines.json` medium override retagging all three of Denma's
lines `manhwa` so the KR line resolves as the origin; see `corrections/README.md`'s
"medium override" section). The override is correct, but it exposed a mislabelling
one level up: the line tagged `ja` is not a Japanese print edition at all — its
titles are hangul and its numbering is the Naver webtoon's own episode-arc list
(2010-01 to 2012-01), i.e. the SAME Korean web serialization the `ko` line's print
volumes collect, not a translation of it. The `en` line is the LINE Webtoon
translation of those same episode arcs. Follow-up (not done): either correct the
`ja` line's `market` to `KR` (it would then likely fold into the `ko` line or need
its own composition mapping), or teach `export/line_status.py` to exclude an
episode-arc line from the stalled/behind comparison entirely — comparing 16 web
episode arcs against 19 print volumes is comparing different units, which is why
the fix's two newly-`stalled` lines (`Denma (Episodes) [en]` and `[ja]`, both "16 of
19, last dated vs. origin last dated") are an artefact of the mislabelling rather
than a real signal. Not blocking; the origin fix itself (`orig_series_id` now
pointing at the Korean line) is correct and should ship.

## 2026-09-21 — publish opentome-2026-09-21 (Rascal Does Not Dream vol. 16)

Nick's "Publish the OpenTome catalogue" (10:53 CDT): `catalogue.yml` dispatched with `publish=true` (run 35622036076: every gate green, publish + Discord announce succeeded; `manga-metadata.sqlite` 30,756,864 B on the `metadata` release at 15:56Z). Only change since 09-18: `corrections/lines.json` entry adding the English *Rascal Does Not Dream* vol. 16 (*Beach Queen +*, Yen Press 2026-08-11, 979-8-8554-3445-3) — the pipeline had the line at 15. Mangarr picked it up on a forced `MetadataUpdate` (opentome-2026-09-18 → 2026-09-21) and the entry now shows 16 volumes with the Audible ASIN on vol. 16. `lines.json` is additive (INSERT OR IGNORE on the line and its volumes), so a single new volume is the right shape for a missing tail volume.

## What this is now

OpenTome is a CI-built catalogue. The `catalogue` workflow runs the whole pipeline
(`tier0/rebuild_all.sh`) every Sunday and on demand: every unit test, the audit, the
artifact contract test and the measure gate, on a warm source cache. A scheduled run
builds and gates and stores the artifact as a run artifact — it never publishes.
Publishing is a human decision: someone presses *Run workflow* with `publish = true`,
and `export/publish.sh` creates the release `opentome-YYYY-MM-DD` on
`DrAwesome441/mangarr-metadata` and re-points the `metadata` alias at it. Every Mangarr
install polls that alias's `version.json`, verifies the sha256 and swaps the new
catalogue in — nothing to configure on the user side.

The repository carries no browser and no editing site. Corrections arrive as pull requests against
`corrections/*.json` (see `corrections/README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`); a check runs on
every PR. Issues use the four templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## State of play

Last measured build: `opentome-2026-09-18` (the artifact's `meta.gcd_dump`).

- Artifact `manga-metadata.sqlite`: 11,657 series (release lines), 112,083 volumes
  + 938 `volumes_special`; 78,956 aliases; corrections applied: 0 (all three files are
  still `[]`).
- Measure gate (stage 8d, replaying Mangarr's series pick over the committed
  `export/fixtures/library.json`): matched 48/49, coverage failures 0. The one miss is
  *Mushoku Tensei: Roxy Gets Serious*, a spin-off line the catalogue does not carry yet.
- AniList ids: 42/48 picked lines carry one; 2,214 of the 2,522 English lines with
  three or more volumes are bound (the README's 2,614 / 3,053 figure counts every
  English line, not only those with 3+ volumes).
- Every source response is cached under `.cache/` (never committed); the CI cache is
  seeded once by the `seed-cache` workflow and kept warm by `cache-keepalive`.

## Gates

Every one of these exits non-zero and stops the build; none is optional.

- **Stage 0 — unit tests:** `tier0/test_parser.py`, `tier2/test_resolve.py`,
  `export/test_resolve_anilist.py`, `export/test_measure_fixture.py`.
- **Stage 7 — audit:** `tier2/audit.py` reports remaining defects and fails on any.
- **Stage 8c — artifact contract:** `export/test_artifact.py` asserts the consumer's
  schema, the id contract and every committed correction.
- **Stage 8d — measure gate:** `export/measure_library.py` replays a real library's
  series matching against `export/fixtures/library.json`; a coverage failure (an owned
  volume the picked line lacks) fails the build before the new artifact replaces the old.

`export/publish.sh` adds two refusals of its own: the label must be `opentome-YYYY-MM-DD`
and `meta.alias_provenance` must be `opentome` — the clean-room guard.

### 2026-09-19 — publisher hygiene, Discord announce
- `tier0/main_articles._publisher_field`: one clean publisher from a `<br>`/`<small>`/residue-glued infobox field (prefers the entry that is not former/expired/revoked, then one marked current/present/print, else the first); used for `publisher` and every `publisher_en` value. Contract rule `publishers with markup` in `export/test_artifact.py`. CI build 35453130837: `publishers with markup: 0` (was 113), measure gate `matched 48/49, 0 coverage failures`. **Not published yet — the next `publish=true` dispatch ships it** (Nick's gate).
- `catalogue.yml`: on a publish, an embed goes to the Mangarr Discord `#catalogue` (secret `DISCORD_CATALOGUE_WEBHOOK`; the step is skipped when the secret is unset).
- Looked at and left: 3,947 lines with blank status (1,530 main lines whose work has no Wikipedia status, 1,558 sub-lines that deliberately do not inherit the work's status) and 53 lines with zero volumes (real works without a volume table; 13 are sub-lines that could be folded into their parent via `id_redirect` — not done, no consumer needs it).

### 2026-09-20 — `series.author`
- `export/to_mangarr.py`: new nullable `series.author` column, the first name of the work's tier-0 `author` claim (the main article's infobox), on every line of the work; Mangarr reads it when present (a pin there overrides it). Wiki residue tier-0's one-pass template strip leaves behind (`Kentaro Miura ({{nowrap| 1–41}})`) is removed at export; a parenthetical that still says something (`Jitakukeibihei (Natsume Akatsuki)`) stays; an entry that is only a qualifier (`(1994–1998)`) is not a name. Contract rule `authors with markup` + info line `series with an author` in `export/test_artifact.py`. Local build: 9,598 / 11,658 lines carry an author, ids carried with 0 churn, measure gate `matched 48/49, 0 coverage failures`. **Not published — the next `publish=true` dispatch ships it** (Nick's gate).

### 2026-09-21 — volume titles, per-line status, orig_series_id, cover harvest guard
- `export/to_mangarr.py` binds `volumes.title` from the pipeline's row title instead of `None`, dropping a title that is number-only, carries wiki markup (`{{ }} [[ ]] <ref <br <!-- <ruby </`), is in kana/CJK/hangul on a non-origin-market line, or merely restates the series name plus a number. A leading series-name prefix (`Sword Art Online 1: Aincrad` → `Aincrad`) is stripped first. Local export (against a pipeline DB that predates the tier-0 change below): 9,317 titles kept (ja 7,018 / en 1,882 / fr 406 / ko 11); dropped: number-only 6, markup 143, wrong-script 1,766 (EN 1,750, FR 16), redundant 213; prefix stripped 57. The wrong-script count is the measure of the old title pick: the row's title was the first non-blank of `(Title, OriginalTitle, LicensedTitle)` regardless of market. **Tier 0 now picks per market (7a200b6, this round):** `wikipedia_volumes.py` carries `title_original` / `title_licensed` (en: `OriginalTitle` / `LicensedTitle`; fr: `titre_1` / `titre_2`; generic `Title` / `titre` as fallback) and `schema/load.py` binds the licensed one on the licensed row — the CI rebuild is the first build to show it (expect the wrong-script drops to collapse and en titles to rise). `_clean` also unwraps `{{Nihongo2|…}}`, `{{japonais|…}}`, `<ruby>` and drops an unterminated `<!--`.
- `series.status` is now per LINE for a licensed market with a resolvable origin (`completed | ongoing | stalled`), from new `export/line_status.py` + `export/test_line_status.py`: `stalled` = at least two volumes behind the origin, nothing dated in 24 months, origin kept shipping. Origin-market and omnibus lines keep the work's status. `series.orig_series_id` is written for every resolved licensed line — the origin counterpart chosen by medium (manhwa/webtoon → KR, manhua → CN then TW), else earliest first release, else the old JP/KR/CN/TW order. Known accepted defect: Denma (medium `manga`, ko line) still resolves to its ja edition — the medium hint only applies to manhwa/manhua/webtoon.
- Transition table against the 2026-09-20 artifact (`export/to_mangarr.py` prints it and writes `build/status-transitions.tsv`): NULL→completed 594, NULL→ongoing 309, NULL→stalled 40, ongoing→stalled 153 — 193 lines stalled in all, 122 of them English (Warlord left the set once its origin resolved to KR).
- Contract additions in `export/test_artifact.py`: allowed `status` set is now `{completed, ongoing, stalled, NULL}`; `stalled` invariants (`orig_series_id` required, no dated volume in the last 24 months, at least two volumes behind its origin); `orig_series_id` pointing at a missing series, another work, or an origin-market mismatch; volume titles with wiki markup; volume titles that are only a number.
- `tier1/covers.py:45`: the openBD cache reader checked only the FIRST element of a cached response list for a `summary` key, so a batch whose first ISBN was unknown was skipped whole. Now checks every element. Cache-only, zero requests (`covers_from_cache`); local before/after on this workstation's `.cache/`: `cache files 15,695 -> cover URLs for 12,311 ISBNs (openbd 125, openlibrary 12,186)` → `... 12,313 ISBNs (openbd 127, openlibrary 12,186)`. English/French coverage does not move — bounded by what Open Library returns for ISBNs it knows, which is already fully harvested (`docs/legal-position.md`, `corrections/README.md`).
- Local gate (`export/test_artifact.py`): 33/34 rules ok. The one fail, `publishers with markup: 114`, is the local pipeline DB predating the tier-0 publisher fix from 2026-09-19 (`_publisher_field`); CI, which rebuilds from a clean cache, reports 0 — not a regression from this round.
- Stage 0 unit tests green: `tier0/test_parser.py`, `tier2/test_resolve.py`, `export/test_resolve_anilist.py`, `export/test_measure_fixture.py`, `export/test_line_status.py`.
- **Not published — the next `publish=true` dispatch ships it** (Nick's gate); the Sunday `catalogue` build picks it up regardless.
- Two rules a reader of the status column needs: (1) a non-main licensed line (arc, side story) that has reached its origin's top volume with neither market shipping for 24 months is `completed` even if the work is `ongoing` (207 lines take this path; all were NULL before); (2) `release_line.status` is no longer consulted for a licensed line with a resolved origin — the corrections-only `cancelled` idea would need the exporter to read it first. Hand-checked title corrections bypass the lossy title filters (`title_for_export(trusted=...)`) so `corrections/volumes.json` titles round-trip; markup / number-only rejects still apply and the corrections check should refuse those at authoring time (follow-up). CI now keeps `build/status-transitions.tsv` as a run artifact. The first post-merge CI build (run 35678933785) failed in `tier2/audit.py`: its un-split-arc scan read the new per-market titles and saw an English publisher's sub-series numbering restart ("… Progressive 1/2") inside a line the splitter left whole — the scan now covers origin-market rows only (the titles the splitter itself reads).
- **PUBLISHED 2026-09-22 ~01:00 CDT by Nick's dispatch (run 35726050230, publish + Discord announce green) as `opentome-2026-09-22`; the build-only rehearsal was run 35679310812 (same numbers):** titles kept 11,454 (ja 7,522 / en 3,465 / fr 456 / ko 11) — the tier-0 pick lifted English titles from 1,882 to 3,465 and cut wrong-script drops from 1,766 to 170; markup drops 54; prefix stripped 95; redundant 247. SAO's English light novels read Aincrad / Fairy Dance. Transition table unchanged in shape: NULL→completed 596, NULL→ongoing 309, NULL→stalled 40, ongoing→stalled 153 (193 stalled, 122 English). The run's `status-transitions.tsv` lists every stalled line — read before `publish=true`. Seen in the samples, a follow-up: a `LicensedTitle` like `Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation (Light Novel) Vol. 14` survives the redundancy check because of the `(Light Novel)` qualifier between name and number.
- Open items: the Denma `orig_series_id` defect (accepted, not blocking); the local `build/opentome.db` needs a full rebuild to reflect the tier-0 title pick; `_clean`'s `{{japonais|…}}` / `{{nihongo…}}` unwrap is regex-based and garbles a title whose template nests another template (~101 of 1,028 fr `titre_*` fields, ~4 en) — the exporter's markup filter drops the ones that keep a `}}`, the rest leak a stray `|`; follow-up: brace-balanced unwrapping with the depth counter `_templates()` already uses. Mangarr consumer follow-ups (separate repo, after publish): `SubtitleOf` should take the artifact title as its first candidate before the Google Books record; `MapGcdStatus` should map `stalled` to a visible Stalled state instead of falling back to AniList (which reads a still-running Japanese series as Continuing — safe but loses the signal).

## Next

Phase 3 is done (2026-09-18). What runs where now:

- **Build + publish:** GitHub Actions in this repository. `catalogue` runs every Sunday
  09:00 UTC (build + every gate, never publishes); a maintainer publishes by dispatching it
  with `publish = true`. First CI build: run 35387125298 (identical figures to the last
  workstation build, ids carried exactly); first CI publish: run 35393862685 →
  `opentome-2026-09-18` on `DrAwesome441/mangarr-metadata`, alias `metadata` re-pointed,
  picked up by Mangarr the same hour.
- **Cache:** the Actions cache, seeded from the private `opentome-cache` repo's `seed`
  release (run 35387058848), kept warm by `cache-keepalive`.
- **Site:** `pages` builds `site/` on push, on every `catalogue` completion and on a
  Sunday schedule; live at the GitHub Pages URL, moving to opentomedb.com once DNS
  resolves (custom domain is set; HTTPS enforcement follows the certificate).
- **Corrections:** issues and pull requests here; `corrections check` runs on every PR.
  The first one through the path — #1, the English light-novel line of Mushoku Tensei
  (Seven Seas, 26 volumes, every ISBN and date from an Open Library edition record) — is
  merged and in the next build (`rl_250d21561d35`); it reaches Mangarr on the next publish.
  It also found a gate bug: the artifact contract's "multi-entry composition" heuristic
  (`LENGTH > 3`) refused `[10]`; the export now carries composition only for omnibus lines
  and the rule checks the real invariant.
- **Retired:** the old browser and the workstation rebuild agent — nothing OpenTome-related
  runs outside CI. The pre-CI history stays on the maintainer's private mirror.

Open, in order of value:

1. **Publish again** so the Mushoku Tensei line, the publisher hygiene and `series.author` reach consumers (a maintainer's dispatch).
2. The `metadata` alias release's notes on `mangarr-metadata` still describe the pre-OpenTome
   (GCD-era) artifact; they should be rewritten to the OpenTome text (maintainer decision —
   it changes existing release content).
3. Known data defects surfaced by the site: 113 `series.publisher` values carry Wikipedia
   infobox markup (`<br>`, `<small>`); 53 lines have `volume_count = 0`; `status` is blank on
   3,946 lines; `country` is empty everywhere; `mangaupdates_id`/`mangadex_id` are unfilled.
4. DNB as the German primary source (`docs/german-market.md`) — today's German lines come
   from Wikipedia only; the site says so.
5. The multi-market validation spike; per-line pages on the site (v2).

## Gotchas for contributors

- A `catalogue` run fails at its cache step (`fail-on-cache-miss`) until `seed-cache` has run once on `main`; that is deliberate — a cold build would spend hours of polite-rate requests and be killed by the 180-minute limit.
- **Never pipe a gate's exit away.** `set -o pipefail` is on in `rebuild_all.sh`; a
  `| tee` or `| head` around a gate outside it hides the failure the gate exists to raise.
- **`gcd_dump` is a legacy key name.** It labels the build (`opentome-YYYY-MM-DD`) and
  is kept for the updater's contract; the catalogue contains no GCD data.
- **Ids are a public contract.** `tome_id` / `tome_work_id` are never reused or
  re-keyed; the export carries integer ids forward through `id_map` from the last
  published artifact (CI downloads it before the rebuild). A merge writes `id_redirect`.
- **Corrections must pass `python3 tier2/corrections.py --check`** — well-formed,
  `source_url` and `checked` present, every key resolving against a published artifact
  (`--artifact <download>`; the default is the last local build). The PR check runs
  exactly that against the `metadata` release.
- **`.cache/` is never committed.** It is raw third-party responses whose redistribution
  the sources' terms do not allow. A cold build re-fetches everything under each
  source's rate limit (Wikipedia 429s without the 1.1 s throttle; put a real contact in
  the User-Agent) and takes hours.
- **Scheduled workflows on a public repository pause after 60 days without commits.**
  A merged PR resets the clock; a paused `catalogue` schedule shows on the Actions tab.

The pre-CI engineering history (2026-08 → 2026-09) is preserved on the maintainer's
private mirror.
